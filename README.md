# movie-content-filter-extension
 Browser extension project for Movie Content Filter, to allow users to skip objectionable content on streaming services, based on their preferences.

 This project is in very early development right now, and there are many features to add (and some bugs to fix). Currently it is only a Chromium extension, but I am hoping for the extension to be expanded to non-Chromium browsers, such as Firefox and Safari, in the future. Support is being added first for Amazon, Netflix, and Disney Plus, with the hope to later expand to other streaming services.

Like the open-source VideoSkip and Play It My Way extensions that this extension is built on, this extension "does not infringe media copyrights because the video files are not altered in any way. Simply, users choose to see or not to see parts of the content, and the app remembers their choice" (quoted from the VideoSkip README [here](https://github.com/fruiz500/VideoSkip-extension/blob/master/README.md)).
