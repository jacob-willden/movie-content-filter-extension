# movie-content-filter-extension
 Browser extension project for Movie Content Filter, to allow users to skip objectionable content on streaming services, based on their preferences.

 This project is in very early development right now, and there are many features to add (and some bugs to fix). Currently it is only a Chromium extension, but we are hoping to expand the extension to non-Chromium browsers, such as Firefox and Safari, in the future. Support is being added first for Amazon, Netflix, Disney Plus, and Hulu, with the hope to later expand to other streaming services.

Like the open-source VideoSkip and Play It My Way extensions that this extension is built on, this extension "does not infringe media copyrights because the video files are not altered in any way. Simply, users choose to see or not to see parts of the content, and the app remembers their choice" (quoted from the VideoSkip README [here](https://github.com/fruiz500/VideoSkip-extension/blob/master/README.md)).

Notice to Netflix and Hulu Users: While this extension and its users are legally protected from liability under the United States Family Entertainment and Copyright Act of 2005, there are clauses in the Terms of Service for Netflix and Hulu that forbid the modification of their content (section 4.6 and section 3.4a respectively). We are not sure if filtering would be considered modification of their content or not (though we interpret it as the modification of the performance of the content rather than modification of the content itself). Netflix also has a section in their Terms of Service that prohibits code insertion (section 4.6), without mentioning if code insertion is allowed for legal purposes, such as filtering.

If the owners of any of these streaming services were to think that your use of this extension violates their Terms of Service, they could terminate your account. We find this scenario to be unlikely however, because this would only hurt the streaming services financially. In addition, there are larger, proprietary filtering services that support these streaming services, such as Clearplay and Enjoy Movies Your Way, that have not faced this issue as far as we know. While we think it is unlikely that these streaming services would take such action against their users, we wish to inform our users so they can make the decision themselves whether to filter (or not filter) content that is available through these services.
