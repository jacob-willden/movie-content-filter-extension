packaged for convenience.  They have their own source codes available.

Note also that we used parts of the 7-Zip program, that 7-Zip is licensed under the GNU LGPL license, see http://www.7-zip.org, where its source code can be found.

Some binary builds of dvdid are also distributed here.  See http://www.srcf.ucam.org/~cjk32/dvdid (in an email he said he'd release them under a BSD or other permissive type license)

TsMuxer binaries are included, with their own license, see vendor/tsmuxer1.10.6/licence.txt (it allows for redistribution).
