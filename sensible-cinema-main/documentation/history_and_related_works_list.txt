== Overly Verbose History ==
	Sensible Cinema was preceded by EDL's [2] of video editors in the 90's, CleanFlicks (both analog and digital/DVD incantations, late 90's), and more recently mplayer began to support
EDL and zoomplayer had added a scene-cut editor some years ago (and a place to share them[5] since 2004). PowerDVD added a "movie remix" feature (for DVD's, blu-ray) with its version 8 (including the ability to share remixes with others on the MoovieLive web site since 2008 [3]), movie-content-editor[22] came along, and also many other editors have supported EDL for content creation and/or playback, such as mythtv/XBMC's EDL support  (as suggested by the phantom edit[1], from oreillynet.com). VLC also added playlists with optional start and stop positions per entry.  Ffmpeg, mencoder were high quality video editing open source video tools. Once I discovered all of these previously existing programs, I knew the right pieces were ready.

	See also the "related" section, and "motivation" section.  See also the change_log_with_feature_list.txt file, and several blog entries I've posted to various blogs.

	Originally the project started as a prototype to "watch hulu (online) and netflix instant movies edited."[6] Then I realized I could basically have the same effect in any video player
(VLC) to "play from second x to y" and then "play from z to q muted" etc.[7] It basically was implementing Edit Decision Lists (EDL's) using playlists and VLC. I just passed VLC a playlist, it did all the work for me, without any necessary tracking on my part. This seemed to be a different approach than some other programs out there take, so I explored this route. There were even a few released versions with this feature. They avoid real-time tracking by specifying "play from here to here" not "skip from here to here" as some other players do.

	Then it occurred to me that one could grab the several clean segments off a movie file, and piece them together to create an edited clean version (a la CleanFlix).  This also avoids
realtime tracking, so I also included this ability. The playlist option is disabled in later releases, as it was deemed too non-user-friendly, and because VLC timing is "different" than standard DVD players, so I decided to just use standardized timing, though it worked fine for VLC playbacks. I replaced it with support for mplayer's EDL format, which works better, and has consistent timing, though it is still a bit buggy. Please report any issues you may find with it.

	You can see a full list of other features that have been published and demonstrated in the accompanying file change_log_with_feature_list.txt.  Each feature mentioned works in some
released version of sensible-cinema though some features have been removed in subsequent versions (they're all available as rubygems).

	Who knows what the future will hold...

[6] It uses screen snapshots (of specific locations where the digits are expected, based on window positions) and then tracks, using OCR of the on-screen (converting to timestamp), to monitor it for specific times relative to an EDL, and reacts appropriately.

	The concepts aren't terribly novel.  Some other previously existing examples:

== Closely Related ==

* XBMC EDL Support (http://wiki.xbmc.org/?title=EDL_(commercial_skipping)_and_SceneMarker_support) - XBMC's scene cut supporter--also contains links to some other editors' support for EDL's.
* mPlayer EDL Support (http://www.mplayerhq.hu/DOCS/HTML/en/edl.html)  - smplayer, for instance, can pick up a file's EDL files automatically.
* PowerDVD -  From version 8 on has a "remix" functionality[44] including some innovative features, such as being able to continue playing with a "blank screen" and adding effects, adding audio (ex: voice overs), "blurring" scenes and sections of movies, and uploading and downloading (sharing) remixes with others through a central point of distribution. Some people have made downloadable collections for it, as well, see: PC No Evil[1]. There is also a canonical ability to share remixes with others on the MoovieLive web site since 2008.[3] Works with blu-ray, as well, with later versions of PowerDVD
* ClearPlay (http://clearplay.com) - a commercial "filtering" DVD player. See the "motivation" section of the README for a description. It does offer a few features that Sensible Cinema supports but does not, like (user flexible) content decisions.
* Zoom Player (http://www.inmatrix.com) - zoom player's "scene cut editor" (and a place to share scene cuts with other at http://forum.inmatrix.com/index.php?showtopic=129 since 2004). Also works with blu-ray.
* Movie-Content-Editor (http://code.google.com/p/movie-content-editor) - Player written in Python, controls VLC using libvlc, to mute out parts based on subtitles (it parses them for profanity) and user-input/edit'ed EDL's, using edit decision lists in real-time.

* Normal DVD's versus "directors cut" versions of movies (one is at times preferable, content wise)
* DVD's themselves allow for "scripted" playback of certain content, allowing controls for jumping from location to location, switching audio/video tracks, etc.
* Time programmable VCR's - At the least, it can 'skip the first few minutes' of a movie or what not, and, if you're handy with the pause and rewind buttons on you remote, edit offensive content.
* The VCR with its record button, coupled with the stop+rewind button and a list of edits (if even in your head).
* Clean Flicks (used to) sell edited movies.  See also purifiedpictures.com these days.
* Old-school - Ssing the remote control with the pause, mute, stop, fast forward, and play buttons, along with previous knowledge of "questionable" scene locations

Sometimes it even lists the time signatures for events (ex: "Labyrinth" http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091369/parentalguide) which you could use to translate into a sensible-cinema compatible list.  I've even released a version of SC that has working time edits pulled from a wiki like that.

* VidAngel (http://www.vidangel.com) provides for editing using the API of online players, can even beam it to your device (edited) or what not in realtime, via chromecast.  Also has some community collaborative options/playback for youtube. VidAngel also has a concept of "on off checkboxes" for choosing exactly which profanities you want to hear, violence to skip, etc. and uses those when playing back the video, with some euphemisms.  Categories/finer grained control wouldn't be too hard/far off using their system. VidAngel also has an online list of "editable movies" so you can choose from it, it directs you to it.
* libdvdnav had a "remap" feature for several years that allowed you to "skip" from sector to sector in a DVD, to avoid objectionable content.
* http://www.amara.org/en/ [universal subtitles] has a way to super impose text over online videos, probably could be used by us for [text] or obscuring the playback screen, as well.
