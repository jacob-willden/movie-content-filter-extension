== well, probably never care enough to ever do these :P ==

allow x2,y2 for player descriptions...

user-assignable "confidence" (how much time to 'wrap' surround the mutes, etc. to accomodate for slow computers/laggy internet/different players/poor input)

make an index of watchable on imdb ordered by stars (?)

able to make it "quieter" at certain parts, arbitrarily...

can overlay with a "fuzzer-outer" for specific coordinates somehow or other...

"tivo" for BYU-TV or what not.  Tell it when, it records it for you (cut? uncut?)

amazon video on demand

super duper VLC with multi-thread, compiler optimizations...LOL

super easy streamer windows -> {XBOX360, wii, etc..} basically playon.tv competitor, which appears to have no free equivalent, I guess, though you can 
  Currently it's either a cable, a computer (with its cable), or "ask me for this it might already work"
  todo: refit a VLC version that works *if your soundcard supports it*
    test it on the home PC--does it already work? (i.e. can work OOTB with right card)...
    after: make the same work awesome on doze 7 without quality soundcard :)
    make it work with ps3ms?
    make it work from mac...
    make it work seamlessly with all (XBOX360, wii x2, PS3, bravia)
    also make it into a low quality "skype recorder"
    also can I use a "lesser, faster encoder" to get higher resolution?
      is it faster with ffdshow? mencoder?
    blu-ray
      over wired (?)
        LAN?
        does blu-ray work with HDMI well?
        
"If someone builds an app that will allow Google TV to stream video from my computer's iTunes collection, it *could* be worth the investment."
