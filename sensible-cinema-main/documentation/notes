no real way to do virtual desktop with vista+

maybe try the gime...see if it works LOL.

Maybe just *move* it down?

  fauximize for them: expand the current window to be larger than the current screen, but not maximized...

trick maximize somehow?
  [move the maximized window down...]

black bar around all the annoying stuff? or with window...

screen capture it over to some "real" full screen...?
  [or broadcast it...LOL]
more?

: with diego the on screen timestamp 'did conflict' by default, though it is possible to do the popup
  in such a way that it doesn't conflict.  full screen conflicts, too, I believe.  something else we watched there
  didn't conflict.

== gnosygnu patch ==

snow white, jumping 10M past the end puts you at 7M in?

== length of DVD compared ==

basically, 2 different rips get 1s off.  Possibly legitimately. 

Each different type is going to want/need different double start metrics

Hopefully resynchronizing helps :)

Currently DVDNAV conversion...works ok for some DVD's, not ok for others, but might match some file times precisely.
  just not snow white LOL
  OSOH ok (had no breaks tho...)
    that's important, though...yeah.

vlc handles the breaks better, lists 1:23:28 as the sum?
  seems about accurate...

*30/29.97 is actually about equal...so...but...does it go in the "wrong" direction?

typically, it thinks it is 30 fps, but it is actually 29.97...

so typically dvd is ahead...but they are behind in this particular case?

I guess that is ok...so maybe "in this case, they just underestimated"

but if that's the case, then wall time should match mkv time...

  was 1:24:29.27

like a minute extra too long, but consistently?

possibly another fluke?
  possibly mplayer sucks at handling overlaps right, too...
  could tell by rerunning it, was already seeing it at OSD 52:35 ...
  so if it's not there by that point...

noooooooo
the output end time should be some fraction of 29.97/30 ...

assuming makemkv is actually on which...they...might probably be...


demux_mpg: 24000/1001fps progressive NTSC content detected, switching framerate.

with no other changes for quite awhile, assume progressive 24000/1001 fps...


so what I *want* is for wall time in (VLC, mplayer fixed, or powerdvd) to match something 

*sane* like the mkv time :)

pdvd wall time: 5008.669215 == 1:23:28.7 + 1.5 ==  1:23:30'ish


SW dvd advertises as 1:23:28.166 5013.18 so could go up to 1:23:32.16 I believe, if we went that route

handbrake yields a file with length  01:23:34.03
makemkv: 01:23:32.52

dvd advertises as 1:23:28.166 5013.18 so up to 32

actual wall time appeared to be around 1:23:31'ish [?] so makemkv may actually be closest

raw mpeg might be around 01:23:33.44

so my guess is that PowerDVD seeking to 1h would be off in the direction I anticipate

and my conclusion is that rippers all have their own opinion of timings, makemkv might be "most accurate"

PowerDVD 12 seemed to show the same as well clock working "right" for the prince
  and then ended 2 seconds too early? that might be expected...
  I hope this just means PowerDVD is fixed LOL
  
  mplayer OSD nav show 1:23:26, then briefly 1:23:27
    V: 6.4 at the end I believe, so no longer MPEG at the end...oh man this is sooo weird.

  wall time latest: wrist watch started a tidge behind, ended up even further behind (powerdvd [5??])
    1:23:32 sum powerDVD (last OSD I guess?)
    *except* when you scan to the end, then it's 1:23:28 again
    my guess is powerDVD isn't keeping track except internally...
    seeking 1HR "good night" [good] night (her last one)
    yep it's totally internally inconsistent (I assume I'm referring to the OSD matching wall time oddly). Fascinating.
    apple dvd player too, IIRC
    
    with powerdvd 12:
      PDVD's last OSD 1:23:30 "reasonably strong" at least 0.5s showing 30, with an end of 1:23:28 advertised
        got this again with a full run through, exact same, wall time was 
      and if you seek to it, it gets to the "end second shown" 1:23:26 or 1:23:27 then "bumps" to 1:23:28
      yep, this may be still messed up!
        sniff...maybe...EDL's might still work, though...somehow...sniff...
      remember: pdvd wall time: 5008.669215 == 1:23:28.7 + 1.5 ==  1:23:30'ish (or + 2).  It seems like PDVD 12 is tracking wall time still...but...but...played it more quickly than an older version?
      with 60 second build up, last second shown was a reasonably strong 1:23:27

      wall time right on at second 4
        first black after blue == 5010.79
        prolly 5011.69 or (5012.0'ish == 1:23:32)
        powerdvd is reporting a half and half MPEG to wall time with this new version? huh?
         or maybe it just loses a second at the beginning or something...I'm thinking that the wall time is actually 1:23:32, at least that would simplify things on my brain a bit :)
           though possibly I didn't quite start the timings on?
        it "becomes" 1s behind wall time, and is 1:23:31? that's still like 1s off makemkv grumble grumble.
           the take home is "everybody has their own timings" I suppose...
     LODO try it with the old PDVD again? or it may have been a fluke with a few extra seconds thrown in there :P
       we'll assume we understand what was happening and leave this awful DVD behind LOL
  VLC walltime:
    around 5005.62 [?] which...might seemingly be timing-wise off for whatever reason though (VLC bug? timing issue?)
  mplayer wall time: 5005.5+..."a few seconds" (should be 5010?) ok this is hurting my brain, there might be some legitimate discrepancy between DVD and rips now LOL
    same lesson--don't trust one source to match another...though it might be interesting to see about netflix instant...

so typically NAV packets start less, then get less and less and less, relative to the MPEG timestamp.

so I can "hope" that I'm matching file times with this, can't I?

for a non iframe. huh?

possibly it's doing audio "from 1 to 11" then when it hits audio, its skipping some (valid) later video frames, for 1, and for 2
  shouldn't it synchronize on having both audio and video available? It doesn't get enough video? and why the warning message "no an i-frame"?

oops looks like it took audio "up to" 11 and video "past" 11?
  
possibly the only question is "are you comfortable having less video?" (if so, why does it have an 11.08 pts time frame?) and "why does it have that warning" at all?

so basically MPEG went from 10.082091 -> 15.162167 which is really close.

I don't actually match up, 3.5 to 3.8, *because* my current goal is apparently to psycho-match the
internal MPEG timestamp. Yikes. And it does. Dang :P

YUVP 	0x50565559 	24? 	YCbCr 4:2:2 extended precision 10-bits per component in Y0 U0 Y1 V0 order.

maybe the Y is the alpha?


AYUV This is a 4:4:4 YUV format with 8 bit samples for each component along with an 8 bit alpha blend value per pixel. Component ordering is A Y U V (as the name suggests).


special:

                if( p_trans[i_x+1] > 0xaa )


YUVA might be 1,2,2,1



"YUV" mostly means "Y′CbCr" typically Y is strongest.


looks like alpha is 3:
            i_trans = vlc_alpha( p_pal[p_trans[i_x]][3], i_alpha );

y is 0
u is 1
v is 2


a comes from A_PLANE

interesting, maybe I need to be "writing" to pitches too?

                {

theirs loops with their vendored libdvdnav
  theirs works with real DVD paths LOL ignore that then

dvdnav:// actually has "times" that match its "seek tos"
  they just don't match reality :P
  "don't you get it, Ben?"
  
dvdread:// has "times" that match its "seek tos"
  1:00:00 "don't you get it, Ben?"

  should be "I found The Charlotte?...[]The Charlotte?" if it follows sum NAV times...which it doesn't :P
  so they're both bworked, or what?
    dvdnav at least is returning some phreaky ratio: (double)pos / (double)len;
      I guess this lets it...seek ok [but it doesn't always?]
      sounds bworked to me...

dvd://D:\ *is* dvdnav.

dvdnav_get_duration

dvdread seems to be 'seek this many blocks'

typedef int64_t mtime_t;
int64_t pgc_length;  /* the length of the current program chain in PTS ticks */
i_pgc_length =  event->pgc_length * 1000 / 90;

should be 4:02 => 242 seconds 

30 should be:
  2946600
  
  dvdnav_time_search versus dvdnav_sector_search huh?
     I think sector_search has an "offset" and also a "force me to go forward" aspect, so they don't immediately conflict [?]
    
    pass back needed:
    
    get time 3894009
get length 1718232704
    get time:
     *va_arg( args, int64_t * ) =(  event->pgc_length * 1000 / 90)*pos/len;
    get length:
    *va_arg( args, int64_t * ) = (int64_t)p_sys->i_pgc_length
    
    3M for 2seconds, end of sounds
    

VLC has the right timestamps now, appears.
  guess it's actually consistent (but with wrong times) currently.
  some of them are way off though, right? But at least it always goes forward...
    LODO find more that are off in VLC...
	seems mostly consistent, so hold off I suppose :P

ooh the various mplayer's have *different* looking splits.

Why is mine different than trunk, with the same gcc <sigh>.

Maybe mine is older svn version?
  mine:  SVN-r34269-4.5.1
  svn_upstreamer:  SVN-r34341-4.5.1
  
  that cannot matter though LOL
  
ooh once got the "freaky bad" with the new SVN

== precise skipping dvdnav patch/broken DVDNAV EDL ==

seems to be "more tight" even with gottmann DVD

my EDL output is still "temporarily messed" though...

just skipping "to 58" skips to 
A:  54.5 V:  54.6
which is supposed to skip, at 55, to 58.

So that explains that.


54.0 64.5 0 "the freezer/100% pauser"
skips @ 54 to "an attempted" 64.5
 at which point, it keeps repeating, trying to skip to 

mplayer -ss 64.5 actually goes to 58.4

wow that is bad LOL (and explains it too)

maybe seek_rel is saving me, and seeking +5 within the DVD's sphere?

accurate "edl seek to" clue:
libmpdemux\demux_mpg.c static void demux_seek_mpg(demuxer_t *demuxer, float rel_seek_secs,
                           float audio_delay, int flags)


appears that any "seek me forward 10s" that was 

pts = demuxer->stream_pts; // this is DVD accurate! suh-weet... and a double at that...

seems to (audio) work great now with both -c- and -minc-
  I guess video is just broken, but once the seek is in, and to use it, happiness. yipersz-zy-dipers.

== subtitles sync'ing ==
flight:
 ok now david, if you can:
   srt:    32:44,943 = 1964.94
   actual: 34:26.37 = 2066.37


don't take any
 srt: 00:31:52,931 = 1912.93

srt start: 2:25,000 = 145.00
  actual start:  2:47.98 = 167.98
  
srt end: See you later: 01:22:02,271 = 4922.27
 actual end:                01:25:51.17  = 5151.17

so assuming an algorithm:
  take srt, add 22.98, then multiply srt value by real_sum/srt_sum = (5151.17-167.98)/(4922.27-145.00)

so (1964.94-145)*(5151.17-167.98)/(4922.27-145.00)+167.98 = 2066.37 = 0:34:26.37

was I accurate?

(1912.93-145)*(5151.17-167.98)/(4922.27-145.00)+167.98 =  2012.115 = 0:33:32.12
  actual 33:31.997 close enough.
  srt file sed: 0:33:32.12

my math seems ok...

he starts saying this particular one *before* the subtitles actually display...<sigh>.

seems right borderline...
once it totally got it...

actually he starts speaking at  V:2012.12
bad stuff at 2012.6

how can it have missed it sometimes? huh?

the subtitle is actually at about 2012.03
he starts talking at 2012.07

But also there's .03 of audio out of sync-ness...which shouldn't matter I don't think...

2012.12 2013.47 1

somehow the mute appears to kick in a couple of frames too late...
  maybe one is right on, the next is *after* that frame is already done? [when else can they do it, though, I guess...]
   2012.115967
  
  
without frame drop et al, audio gets ahead

  it does *not* seem to be an A-V: getting ahead problem, those only get to like 0.008 [must just be buffers or something internal [?]]

seemed to work fine now that I drop frames...yipes!

== mplayer sox at muting DVD's with timestamp resets ==
  yep, I think it does <sigh>
  monster's inc. resets PTS with every chapter LOL

== mplayer muting probs ==

worked fine with muting here...with teeny screen video of monster's inc, work desktop, second 1530-1540, with mplayer_edl
 I think it might be fixed now, in general...maybe...

seemed to work fine with the same edl,  Sherpya-SVN-r33574-4.2.5 (older), on the work desktop, too...hmm...

  actually, smplayer seemed to do (muting) EDL's at 1hr just fine OSOH. and various mplayer's.  All spot on.

== Sintel timing DVD versus file ==

  seemed to work, right on.  Could have had that 0.3s offset, hard to tell for sure :P
  I think we're good to go...sniff...maybe?

libdvdnav notes:

http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/gstreamer-devel/2007-September/015724.html might have a patch of some sort
dvdinputstreamnavigator.cpp seems to handle discontinuities "right" or something like that...a gap?
  I bet they're a bit off, though...
  ok this is nuts
  also, I think/guess I need 3 variables, to track this "right" in mplayer...not sure about VLC...

  appears xbmc just tracks it as "nav wide"
    maybe I don't quite understand discontinuity...
    I...think they are unprecise. Oh man this is weird. oh man.
    so I guess their EDL's are based off of "DVD time"
      however one uses an EDL for theirs :P
    I don't really get it though, now do I? :P
    
I'm guessing mplayer "relative seeks" are totally bworked
  but they're not! they seek to past the break...but that's an absolute seek :P
  so they must be using NAV packets'ish for seeking, so relative seeks on long DVD's are probably bworked


 * DVDNAV_NAV_PACKET
 *
 * NAV packets are useful for various purposes. They define the button
 * highlight areas and VM commands of DVD menus, so they should in any
 * case be sent to the SPU decoder/overlaying engine for the menus to work.
 * NAV packets also provide a way to detect PTS discontinuities, because
 * they carry the start and end PTS values for the current VOBU.
 * (pci.vobu_s_ptm and pci.vobu_e_ptm) Whenever the start PTS of the
 * current NAV does not match the end PTS of the previous NAV, a PTS
 * discontinuity has occured.
 * NAV packets can also be used for time display, because they are
 * timestamped relatively to the current Cell.

Fascinating. I guess the "PTS values" are the mpeg PTS values themselves...fascinating.
  this seems to imply that XBMC's extra additions aren't necessary though, since they already use the NAV packets...hmm...
  
  XBMC seems to pass past the "discontinuity" all right though, timestamp wise...
  
  maybe this "isn't" a real discontinuity? whoa! maybe nav packets aren't timestamped relative to the current cell, in reality?
    Either way, I think you're stuck with the triple. Hmm...
    dvdnav doesn't seem to know about the pts at all, ever...it's gotta be local memory that's the only way DVD players must do it LOL

random conclusions:

commercial" players, like windows media player, will "seek" based on 30 fps, even if
  the underlying is 29.97
	  	
however if you allow them to just continue playing, they use wall time, which is 29.97 fps
	  	
makemkv can give you streams that are up to like 2s out of whack with the DVD.  tsmuxer
	  	
seems to fix those though, if you unmux them.

[ac3 @ 00ca9420]incomplete frame


linux, with yasm, no configure options, updated "lib"
Thread model: posix
gcc version 4.5.2 (Ubuntu/Linaro 4.5.2-8ubuntu4)
interestingly, even if you pause, or seek, it still seems to display the same overlaps.
What could this ever mean?
  1b) it also freezes if you step frame through it LOL.

(with the freaky overlap, but not looping)
  => seems to imply that it's not a configure issue. Either a library or gcc issue? I'm using all the same ffmpeg's...
  => seems to imply that the stream seek is not an mplayer patch...

mplayer_svn_with_my_changes_only_sherpya_gcc_sherpya_configure_nocache_dvdnav
doesn't loop at least :P
  seems to imply the patches don't matter, and the ffmpeg doesn't amtter

note this one matches, with and without search...fascinating. with the *same* super updated ffmpeg version. oh man...
also this still shows that freaky "oh I'm back to 3498.78, or wait now I'm not" thing LOL
However, for now the automated way could (I must suppose) just use the old mplayer, or...

they may have used this ffmpeg:
 Download FFmpeg git rev N-32754-g936d4d4 - 09/21/2011
 use his build environment :P

me building using his complete build environment--diffs, gcc, mplayer version--it worked! phew

maybe it's really restarting for some reason? and that's causing the looping?

MAYBE IT NEEDS TO EQUAL THE ACKET BEFORE THE NEXT RESTART PACKET...
  or maybe it really actually means...add one frame tho :P
  thinking the 0.28 is to allow for an easier "seamless" transition from one to the next...maybe?

  just subtract one, I'm thinking?
0.814500 -  1.067733 -0.25

too hard to tell LOL. (right on a split, might have been whacked out somehow...)

last NAV packet was 2.200000, mpeg at 0.814500 (equiv. to 2.4 about), so we lost 1.6
we have 

 0.81
 0.28
 ...
 0.81
 0.28

 so if we had split twice at 0.81, we'd be close...
   now I'm torn :P

 mpeg 7.245920 -  9.250908  -2.004988000000001
 
 I'm guessing 0.85 is good for now...
   hmm...actually it might be...and this is one phreaky DVD...hmm...sure :P
   
  I'm guessing this one is actually "those each were 1.0s each, and we don't have a new starting 0.2 at all" however, the "add one frame"
    thing actually almost gets us close...plus we can warn if we're past a split...
    should be 0.81 + 0.04+0.24

seeking in dvd:// might be broken if MPEG is...not it should work all right, it's using the VOBU...hmm...
  so basically when seeking, what it "should" do it seek you forward until you get to the right spot, one frame at a time, I guess...
  so I could maintain a table of "vobu -> mpeg times" when I pass one...maybe...or maybe for each frame, update the vobu map...

Invalid seek to negative position 28ed40810b2000! # freeze...hmm...and just with mine? huh?

old ones used to work? huh?
  svn log on that file didn't  33601 latest for dvd://
  
  I guess it only matters what mplayer "thinks" is the split, but still...huh?
    which might be different for dumpstream of dvd:// versus dvdnav:// whoa!
    I guess we're ok then...

when actually playing it though...
V:3498.98

then 0.00 for the next, which...may mean you should add one frame worth to it :)
  so imagine a split at 3499.02

osd_level 3 osd_fractions 1
last NAV packet was 3495.733398, mpeg at 0.417083 after -> 29.97 3499.229248

you can infer from that that it's 3498.36 + 7 frames, which is close'ish-er...

hmm, basically...the same-ish LOL. prefere dvdnav barely...

now I'm 2:01:30.36 = 7290.36
mpeg 13791.14
split 3499.4
"should" sum to 7290.54, so I'm 0.2 too low, that's with adding it in.

I "could" fix it by not adding anything...it appears so, anyway, then I'd be within 0.02 the whole way...I guess...
either that or I got the split time wrong.

starts 5.994675 > 5.955780
  so about 0.04 ahead, but that's with the addition of 0.175 I think.
  what's up with the creep?

I wonder if it adds in the equivalent of the initial 0.28 back in by the end of the film. Oh man LOL.
  nope
  
last NAV packet was 6589.966797, mpeg at 6597.194336 after -> 29.97 6596.556641

still 0.03 too high now.
I have no idea.


If I'm low, then just use theirs.
Else, add 0.

== 3600 dvdnav OSD ==

fascinatingly, playing dvdout seems to have exactly "on" OSD to the standard time on the console.  Exactly.
  Dunno
  then the OSD actually resets after the shift at 25:46.  Fascinating.  It's just using the mpeg for the OSD I guess (including its opening 0.28 extra secs)

 with -ss 3600 dvdnav://, it seeks me to V:3597.7 (should have 3.6 second diff) hmm...
    how does it do seeking today, dvdnav
    
    59:56.96, should be 59:56.4
      exhibits the weird freaky roundingness...almost a full second of it [?]
    maybe off then...
    
    
    that 0.96 could be coming off the 'real' stream
    YES IT'S LOCK STEP

with my stuff and dvd://, it shows the same "update only at 0.5s"
  hmm <sigh>
  with or without my patches, it sucks like that.
  and its seeking speed is abysmal... hmm...maybe that's just in debug mode? huh?
  but maybe accurate?
  
  so it's exactly the same fix...
  
  My easy fix would be to "remember" the last spot in the demuxer...maybe...
    The real fix would be to fix dvdnav
    
  dvd:// had the same "we're using the exactly wrong extension"
  
  dvd:// on seek to 3600:
     V:3604.21'ish [kind'er close to DVD time?]
  dvdnav:// on seek to 3600:
     V:3597.71'ish huh? implementation detail?
  
  should some stuff be moved to libdvdread from stream_dvd.c ?

    seems those NAV packets are like 0.21 behind?
      so now they *match* the file based ones, that require an offset.  Oh man this is nuts!
      But the only way I guess...
      OSOH ffmpeg start: 0.280633
      still a couple of frames off though...

   NAV packet was 604.000000, mpeg at 604.837769 now 604.0000009 -> 604.60 # 0.23 off
  
   might be able to peel off more accuracy via
  
    sintel:
      NAV packet was 0.000000, mpeg at 0.033367 now 0.033367
      NAV packet was 0.000000, mpeg at 0.367033 now 0.367033  # we already get this one...
        and ffmpeg is at 0.30? huh?
      AVS says it starts at 0.40, which kind of corroborates mplayer...
      I'm ok with 0.07 missing I guess...they all seem to have this don't they?
        should I always subtract an extra 0.08 from it tho? yeah, really why would that be?
        0.28 -> 0.21?
        Jonah no, sintel yes, OSOH yes, c yes. I guess inferring is all right here?
        
        So basically, for me to currently accomodate for this, I'd need to pass it into mplayer, and it would have to add it back in.
          Until EDL tracks the accurate DVD time I guess.
          I'm good with being 1/10th out. No worries there :P

somehow I "thought" maybe powerdvd was accurate but off by 0.5s?

It "might" round up the times.
  13 clicks to get to 00:01
  then like 30 to 00:01
     inconsistent?
    
dvdsample.exe 
  57:50 f10 (57:53.89)
was like 2 seconds ahead at =c= car turning left, front tire visible
  and like 3 seconds ahead at the very beinning?

  54:47.92 OSD -> 3467.92 30 fps (29.92: 0:57:51.39 )
     no hiccups...
    
    mplayer OSD math might be messed up, it keeps jumping all around...

      also with monster's inc.
      mplayer bug :P
      at least it's "always" 1s off.
      I think it's just with dvd's {both dvd:// and dvdnav://}

 this one is *way* too many clicks...maybe the update time is some type of suggestion?  Maybe it's off by negative one VOB unit?

 it "appears" to be advancing by one frame at a time, but its numbers are way whacked compared to powerdvd. Sorry!

what about handbrake? starts at 0?

makemkv (ripper) was heading me south, perhaps?
  does this explain Snow White?
  
This might explain DVD times not syncing right, as well... (the extra 0.5s it "says" it has, but then doesn't)

0.28 is not accomodated in sums:

handbrake 5fps:

  A:   1.0 V:   1.0
  A:   1.1 V:   1.1 => 1.10 => corroborate,

if you pass it -ss 1:00:00 it seeks to 3604, i.e. it seeks I think to the 30 fps spot :P

But that's just with dvd:// with dvdnav:// it seems to be right on...maybe it has smarter seeking in it or something?

when seeking in the TS it started 0.4 past, but I guess maybe that's expected...

== compare upscaling settings ==

regular pullup not very good :P
just with hqdn3d, same low res, seemed not very good
I seem to slightly prefer DVD to directx upscaling (at least).  More detail.
  more hair detail, wood has more detail
    
with qt viewer:

  with 0001:
    1x and 2x seem same
      like identical
  with 26
    seem identical
  99: 
    2x seems to barely pull out more detail out of the metal...interesting...
    
with mplayer to view the jpg (direct3d)
  01:
    wow looks igualzinho weird
  26: 
    igualzinho
  99:
    igualzinho (too dark to tell...kind of weird there) -- ffmpeg bug?
    
  more hair, -ss 2:44 -frames 300
    I guess the same way, -> jpg, compare the jpgs in quicktime
      then tweak it be able to screen scrape it to compare [?]
  
    2x takes *way* way longer...
    
    00:
      if there's a difference, I can't easily see it in picture viewer
    75:
      1x has better "lines" than raw

      2x igual 1x
    299:
      raw looks BETTER wood-wise hmm...
      
    really need a better way to record maybe?
    make mplayer go really slow, and have ffmpeg record it from screen [?] -> jpg and hopefully it will catch everything...
      
== upconvert netflix ==

=== mplayer avisynth ===
  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkOnH36S_pY&feature=player_profilepage
    mplayer's default upscaling seems to introduce wild dots..probably
    I think MS's bundled "magnifier" does some internal smudging for me, otherwise it would look awful
    mplayer at default seems to be doing weird things?
    paint.net on the win32::screenshot capture seemed to match quite well what the screen had.
    ffplay seems to show an exact verbatim copy...
    actually mplayer seems to be a good exact duplicate...maybe resizing hurt it though?
    
=== other ===


media player classic appears to have no cache.
"uscreencapture settings" appears to be per app, so lost with a .grf file save [?]
  or maybe appear to be overridden...by WMC, mplayer10, not virtualdub, not ffmpeg, yes mplayer
  works for a demo, long term probably will need my own filter :)
    though for now I could just tell them "ok download graphedit too LOL, run this in virtualdub, position your window up there"

virtualdub seems to get way behind...maybe it doesn't have the "framedrop" options that mplayer does?
"desktop source" does seem to work well mplayer, though perhaps still a bit jerky...
do I need to add a sleep in there? 
  http://www.eggheadcafe.com/microsoft/Win32-DirectX-Video/31543477/csourcestream-fillbuffer--settime.aspx seems to imply that I should...I think.
What matters is the delta from when the graph started running. http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd377506(v=vs.85).aspx

maybe VLC is just a lot more stingey...hmm...it's because it's the only fella I have actually trying to mix and match audio+video


I think I need to set mine to basically sleep until "almost it's time to do this" type of thing...maybe?

It only seems to make sense to me to go "only as fast as x fps" otherwise...you'll be giving them bogus data!  I cannot
imagine that you can depend on the renderer to "backlog" you to exactly as many fps as you need.
However, this doesn't explain VLC accepting these in such an awful way LOL.
Also, maybe implementing IAMLiveSource would help even VLC...maybe...?

It hates my filter! The only one it loves is that other one... <sigh>. Hacky work around it is then...

    however with mplayer it was like 14fps with aero, 53 without, and 55 with single monitor (?)
    TODO can I get that 800fps somehow? or can I live without it?

  this one mkv seems to have an extra second in there...
    1h 35mn 49s 596ms and "expected" it errantly to be: 1:35:52.4...it's like half and half!
    ts is 1h 35mn 47s 41ms which might be right on compared to the DVD
    so this one implies that makemkv is just messed up? huh? ts seems fine again...
    
  maybe sometimes mkv stretches it double in error somehow?
    maybe it has *both* problems...LOL
  
  wall time seems to be 29.97 (DVD player reports 30) first hour at least
    at 1:09 it appeared to be like 6s "back", though makemkv may have interfered slightly...
    at 1:20 7s

  VLC at least *tries* to support it <sigh>. Oh give me a break. Oh well.
  I could either go with avisynth + MPC (I think)

=== upconverting to the huge monitor===

 with the black laptop:
   "normal" dvdnav seemed to work all right, slightly jerky at times.
  I think that upconverting to the little monitor used more cpu.
  Anything to the big screen maxed out the cpu.
  I "think" it looked better upconverted than not, big screen too, though both really pretty good.  Except the computer not LOL.
  
  work comp. can scale snow white like 30% cpu [is that out of 50?] to 1680...

      2520
    2x res: 40%, awesome
    2160 doesn't seem as good as 3360. I don't know why...
    3360 -> 1680 in software is *way* too slow...
      3360 seems better, anyway...
    2160 versus 1680 didn't seem to make much difference...
    2520 vs 2880 versus 3360
    2520 38% cpu
    2880 looks pretty close...
      barely prefer 3360, but...it may have been a different frame
    barely prefer 2880 to 2520
    does 3360 drop?
      A:  14.6 V:  10.0 A-V: yep (work comp.)
      still seemed to use 40% cpu when multi-cored (sounds like an apple)
      -lavdopts threads=2 13.9 versus 14.2s for first 10s [yes! LOL]
    3360 seems smoother than 2880, like much less pixelated.

No. As long as the GL renderer works with your hardware/driver combination, it's a lot better then the directx/overlay renderer.
You might want to try "gl:yuv=4:cscale=5:lscale=5" for even better rendering quality...

This guy has some very aggressive sharpening parameters [LODO try out]:
  http://www.nrtm.de/index.php/2010/09/11/mplayer-aggressives-scharfen/

   "use the following syntax to playback DVD movies."
Code:
mplayer -pp 0 -vf-clr -vf pullup,yadif=1,hqdn3d=2:1.5:3,scale=-1:-1:0 -ssf ls=100 dvd://

Let us assume that hqdn3d=2:1.5:3 is a good way to clean up MPEG-2 and yadif=1 is a good decent de-interlacer. I would say that the following should work ok for most content.
mplayer -vf yadif=1,hqdn3d=2:1.5:3,scale=-1:-1:0
Maybe adding -ssf ls=100 will increase the sharpness of the content to bring out the details of the video. With mencoder, it is a little different on what options you can use compared to mplayer, so play around with the settings."

  http://cybernetnews.com/cybernotes-skip-commercials-in-windows-media-center WMC can do it too kind of? might apply to the mymovies community...though looks a bit hard :P

    from http://www.mediasmartserver.net/2010/01/29/guide-using-mpc-hc-as-your-video-player-in-wmc-media-browser/ which itself uses the "media browser" plugin

  is thereatek upconverting? forget it either way LOL
  
== subtitle accuracy ==

  narnia dawn treader had 1 subtitle that was "hand crafted", had the wrong timestamps, but was more accurate.  
    The several others were accurate though.

== auto subtitle download for a DVD ==

  splayer doesn't seem to attempt auto-download either of subs for DVD's.  Feels so nice tho :P

  fascinatingly, on the mplayer dump file, the OSD doesn't work right, and resets. LOL
  mplayer dvdnav OSD:
    preceding: 02:10:36.-4
    actual strike: 02:10:36.00

== does it work with makemkv with ts muxer? ==

  OSOH/ title00.ts
    transition: frame 107798 00:59:56.863
    with ffmpeg 3596.82 seems to be in perfect lock-step with the other.
    both have sound.
    perfeito

== so...does it work with makemkv without tsmuxer? ==

  using -ofps 30000/1001 -mc 0 -noskip caused the audio/video to mismatch wildly :P
  extracting audio didn't play back in VLC with correct sig [which means nothing]
  me having to demux to *ts* is not an option :P
  mencoder1 -mc 0 -noskip title00.mkv  -ofps 24000/1001 -of mpeg -mpegopts muxrate=300000 -alang en  -sid 1000 -oac mp3lame  -ovc lavc -lavcopts vcodec=mpeg2video:vrc_buf_size=1835:vrc_maxrate=9800:vbitrate=5000:keyint=1:vstrict=0:acodec=ac3:abitrate=192:autoaspect  -o something.mpg

  demux_mpg: 24000/1001fps progressive NTSC content detected, switching framerate. OSOH only saw it once
  
== ja donatei ==

  ossfarm, putty, tons others, I think...

== ffmpeg vs. AVS vs. powerproducer zact timings...splitting fulli ==

  conclusion: 
    mencoder splitting for zact timing seemss off
    ffmpeg is consistent with ffprobe I...would guess.
      which *seems* to match the DVD "quite closely"

  note this was fulli from mplayer rip...though ffmpeg seemed to match better with both [?]

  transition on fulli:
    avs: 59:56.867, pp: 56.90, avidemux: 56.863
      maybe pp was .86 but didn't update its framing right?
  ffprobe shows possible vcodecs at: 3596.826 3596.793 3596.826 3596.8597 3596.893 3596.926 
    counting them: 107790 doesn't line up at all...10 frames off? it must duplicate some frames implicitly...
  ffmpeg at 3596.866 got avidemux's frame: 59:56.930 (107800)
  ffmpeg at 3596.83 got avidemux's frame: 00:59:56.896 (107799)
  ffmpeg at 3596.82 got avidemux's frame: 00:59:56.896 (107798) which seems to match ffprobe...and imply that 3596.826 is the transition frame [?]
   so basically everything is...one frame off? ffmpeg is one frame off from avs/others?
  mplayer DVD OSD: 00:59:53.25 (converted: 3596.84) V:3597.3 [V value huh? ]
    previous frame to transition one was 59:53:21 [pre-switch] (3596.80 converted)
    about one frame off avs/avidemux []
      . = frame advance in mplayer 
      
  title00.ts
    (non-finger frame)
    AVS on ts (not fulli): ffmpeg's 3596.82 frame is shown 57.042 [+ crash?]
    powerproducer: 57.0 even (meaning probably the frame before 57.03)
    mplayer: 4197.0 [second .0], (OSD from file)
    avidemux on .ts: 00:59:57.347 86250 (but the timing is always off for that one...)
    however with fulli I guess we're closer somehow magically [?]
    
    mencoder 3596.82 seemed *way* too early frame-wise...
      used: mencoder1 -ss 3596.82 -endpos 3 -oac copy -ovc copy  title00.ts.mencoder.fulli.mpg -o  title00.ts.mencoder.fulli.mpg.mencoder.3596.82.mpg
    NB: "non knuckles" *is* the first transition frame...
      and it "should" be OSD, above...huh? the ts file is off?
    
  title00.ts.fulli
    AVS 59:56.887 [phew pretty close again...what?]
    conclusion: the ts is a bit off somehow? what?
    powerproducer: 56.86 or 56.90
    
  AVS on original mkv:
    non finger frame: 56.966 (previous was .926)
  
== ? ==

mkv2vob just extracts singles, not re-muxes them [not useful here]
mkvmerge only ... [not useful here]

conclusions: mencoder -forceidx can make a copied rip file play great in mencoder [and presumably be cut right?]
  makemkv has no problems with/signs of internal resets.
  VLC playing any mpeg *file* is actually pretty close to right on [?]

dvdoutmplayer.mpg.mencoder.ofps.mpg did not save avidemux

VLC playing mpeg *file* is actually pretty accurate.  Oh the insanity...I guess the extra abstraction of reading from disc kills it.

mplayer playing mplayergrab *does* reset internally...and osd also fails...interesting...
  *however* running mencoder1 -forceidx c.mpg -ovc copy -oac copy -o c.mencoderidx.mpg *does fix it* (for mplayer anyway...)
    unfortunately unseekable in avidemux...
  makemkv doesn't reset ever...timestamps are I think 29.97 in that case (both OSD, other)
    tsmuxer on that *lacks* timestamps at all in VLC, mplayer is 10 minutes off, it's in french [?]
      splitting it goes a bit early (oh duh it has all the i-frames still...)
      
== splitting osoh/accuracy ==

old way: rip/fulli with mencoder dvdnav+fulli freaky, split with ffmpeg, join with mencoder

mencoder filename -of mpeg -mpegopts format=dvd:tsaf -alang en -nocache -sid 1000 -oac mp3lame -vf scale=720:480,harddup -ovc lavc -lavcopts vcodec=mpeg2video:vrc_buf_size=1835:vrc_maxrate=9800:vbitrate=5000:keyint=1:vstrict=0:acodec=ac3:abitrate=192:autoaspect -ofps 30000/1001 -o something.mpg
  avidemux on this had way off audio--video looked ok
  avs on this: unseekable
  
ffmpeg -i filename -vcodec copy -acodec copy -ss 3595 -t 10 part1.avi
  transition at 1.835 frame 55 that actually might be right...wow it actually seemed to work I am *flabberghasted*
  avidemux can open it well
  AVS can open it, but not seek nor play it [useless]

the painful virtualdubmod: http://forum.videohelp.com/threads/326615-Play-an-MTS-file-frame-by-frame-displaying-timecode-or-frame-number

machete can't open mpeg avi's :(
  can't open anything from the old work flow...guess it's out.

0.0334 is length of one...except then it ignores that :P

ffprobe (dvdoutmplayer):
  I think pts is what matterz over dts
  duration_time doesn't seem to match LOL.
  3594.904978 3594.955022 [3594.988411 3595.038456] 3595.071822
  videos pts' at: 3596.906978 3596.957022, 3597.040456, 3597.073822, 3597.123878 so telling it 
  last video: 6791.515056 1:13:11.52, or possibly 6791.431644 1:13:11.43
    these don't match AVS precisely...no no...
  first video: pts_time=0.280633 though one was N/A, so what is AVS's 0.016 ? nothing matches? (unless they have some internal counter they're "matching" against it... hmm...)

double check AVS: 

  mplayer 59:56.991 (3596.991) (one at 3596.990411, next at 3597.040456 )
  mkv 56.971 (with lots of back clicks...) 56.987 with 14 clicks... I think hitting the stop button does reset it. clicks divide by 2?
    59:56.969 with lots of forward clicks...
    
  says sum is 1:53:11.334

"ideal" would be a transition at 1.987 I believe (off 59:56.987)

[-5,5]
  1.301 for (avidemux) change of scene for ffmpegdvdout.vlc.8.mpeg, ffmpegdvdoutmplayer.mpg
  2.102 for (avidemux) change of scene ffmpeg.mencoder.dvdoutmplayer.mpg [what is that anyway maybe fulli from dvdoutmplayer ?]
    that looks like an odd difference.  Except maybe they went in different directions searching for an iframe...

  ffmpeg splitting dvdoutmplayer.mencoderfulli.mpeg resulted in no audio avidemux, and the poor video that we saw before in avidemux [way off]
    $ created it with mencoder filename.whatever -of mpeg -mpegopts format=dvd:tsaf -alang en -nocache -sid 1000 -oac copy -vf scale=720:480,harddup -ovc lavc -lavcopts vcodec=mpeg2video:vrc_buf_size=1835:vrc_maxrate=9800:vbitrate=5000:keyint=1:vstrict=0:acodec=ac3:abitrate=192:autoaspect -ofps 30000/1001 -o output.mpeg 
    mencoder splitting the same had audio [seemingly not accurate?], and the same way off video.  Seems that 
    *that* fulli is *honestly* messed [same as in how_to I believe] except now I try it again later and it works? maybe -oac copy messed it up?
    mencoder went really fast though :P
    did have oac copy tho...
    
  mencoder splitting OTHER_SIDE_OF_HEAVEN-1handbrake.ffmpeg.fulli.avi:
    audio was the same as the beginning of the movie LOL [needs to be re-transcoded?]
    transition: 00:00:02.080 frame 52...hmm...maybe 3 frames off/late? hmm...well 3 frames (maybe 2) is better than 9 uh guess (still only 0.1s which...maybe acceptable...)
    
 OTHER_SIDE_OF_HEAVEN-1handbrake.ffmpeg.fulli.avi.ffmpeg.10.mpg
    not even VLC can play/open it LOL
    $ splits it with ffmpeg -i OTHER_SIDE_OF_HEAVEN-1handbrake.ffmpeg.fulli.avi -vcodec copy -acodec copy -ss 3595 -t 10 OTHER_SIDE_OF_HEAVEN-1handbrake.ffmpeg.fulli.avi.ffmpeg.10.mpg
    that was handbrake I suppose...
    
  maybe I can survive with raw mpeg -> fulli ...
  
  AVS *might* be a tidge off, too...but I'm starting to think it might be spot on...but maybe not...

  avidemux on "mp4'ed" ffmpeg dvdoutmplayer:
    transition 00:59:56.963 # maybe machete was rounding this up?

  dvdoutmplayer.ffmpeg-copy.ffmpeg.mpg [NB avidemux likes this much better than avi!] 1.3s [like the old one...]
  
  with big avi's avidemux always says "rebuilding frames", also it did not fix avidemux to become frame accurate, with the normal lossless mpeg's in there.
    cannot avidemux seek, or rather it is truly painful! gah!
    cannot seeming AVS seek? dvdoutmplayer.ffmpeg.copy.avi

 OTHER_SIDE_OF_HEAVEN-1handbrake.ffmpeg.fulli.avi
   when played in VLC, seemed to transition at about 59:56.9'ish
  
 OTHER_SIDE_OF_HEAVEN-1handbrake.ffmpeg.fulli.avi.ffmpeg.10.mpg unplayable in even VLC

 dvdoutmplayer.mpg.ffmpeg.mpg.ffmpegcopy.10.mpg played fine 1.3s, maybe it's an mp3 ffmpeg splitter bug thing?
    from avidemux it's cutting at (albeit useless) 00:59:55.720 

  re-avi or mpeg'ing with ffmpeg doesn't save avidemux. k?
    plus re-mpegin'g it's unopenable with AVS Editor
  
  AVS can't seem to use dvdoutmplayer.mpg ?

== never try ==
  check if mencoder/ffmpeg go forward to backward to find the nearest I-frame...
  mencoder as ts muxer? vlc?
  virtualdubmod mpeg2...
  mkv to mpg? mencoder -ovc copy -oac copy -idx -o <name of the merged file> <files you want to be merged>
  mencoder dvd://1 -oac copy -ovc lavc -ofps 24000/1001 http://www.mplayerhq.hu/DOCS/HTML/en/menc-feat-telecine.html # should set it right :P
  I think ps > ts ? and VLC will trust it? [does it avidemux help?]

== makemkv to mpg OSOH ==

conclusions: 
  tsmuxer is quite good
  makemkv seems great frame-accuracy-wise
    also mplayer...
  makem4v -> tsmuxer -> avidemux isn't enough

tsmuxer cannot unmix handbrake's file.

ffmpeg seems out as ts muxer: https://ffmpeg.org/trac/ffmpeg/ticket/177, even with June 3 version
  Ffmpeg.exe -i myfile.264 -i myfile.aac -vcodec copy -f mpegts -acodec copy output.ts

mencoder "hurls" through it: 
  mencoder -ovc copy -oac copy -idx -of mpeg -o yo.mpg big.mkv
tsmuxer?

  http://www.smlabs.net/en/products/tsmuxer/
  
mkvtoolnix doesn't work...

maybe if I use ffmpeg to fulli it first...

My first question is...does handbrake and makemkv match, +- fulli

makemkv => tsmuxer => ts
  avidemux:
    still needed frame shifter...
    audio still off...
    transition 86250 59:57.347
  
I seem unable to very the frames of the HANDBRAKE one LOL.  It keeps segfaulting Avidemux no matter what it's status...
  plus I can't compare except by framecount, which is probably messed up anyway...hmm...

mkvextract{+...} over tsmuxer?

ffmpeg -r 23.976 -f h264 -i video.h264 -f ac3 -i audio.ac3 -vcodec copy -acodec copy -f vob output.vob 
tsremux ?
m2ts ?

conclusions: mplayer's are consistent grabbing cross-platform
  makemkv is consistent size-wise, same boxes...
  vlc seems to always be consistent with itself, frame-wise
  vlc is off of mplayer/mkv by 0.3s, but not at the beginning so what the....
  can discard vlc dvd :)
  one frame off is probably ok/accurate.
  avidemux cannot read makemkv output.

  mpui has the same "crash" with dvdvnav...

vlc dvd-straight  dvd://f:\@1 --sout "#standard{access=file,mux=ts,dst=dvdout.vlc.dvd.3.mpg}" vlc://quit caused it to go past the end of the title and just keep looping oddly :P
  at the end there was a menu but only for about 5s...hmm...
  mplayer can't play it seemingly.
  avidemux thinks it's the menu, 1 frame long
  this is the loopy one
  vlc can play it at the beginning, seeking seems to end early or...take forever?
  
vlc dvdsimple

Can't figure out how to use the gui at all, files are always blank or not there? yipes.
Looks like dvdsimple still uses dvdnav so we should be all right with dvdsimple I think.

== timing dvd player time versus clock/wall time: ==

at 1:44:00 or so I seemed about 6s ahead. yup yup.
  at end, I had like 1:53:20'ish'ish [?] (ok probably like 1:53:11 but who knows for sure :P)

appears that 29.97 is closer to "wall clock time" and DVD players tell you 1:00:00 when it has taken you 1:00:04 in reality.
  at 1:00:00 wristwatch was about 4s ahead

== using handbrake's file for splitting ==

I think it's accurate...and with conversion to fulli editable in avidemux :P

using ffmpeg/mencoder against handbrake, they seemed to be a few seconds forward I think...sigh...
  TODO figure out how to use handbrake, if I ever need to <sigh> it's almost user friendly, dang!
  TODO try the parsers on the...handbrake fella somehow? avidemux?
  maybe convert to mpeg or something +- GOP 1
  maybe handbrake is "reading my mind" time-wise and inserting 30fps timestamps on each frame?

handbrake -> ffmpeg I think sameq -> ffmpeg split
  avidemux:
    1.96
    same with same file split again...hmm...at least it's consistent...
  vlc:
    no audio
  mplayer:
    I o[o]nce was lost

== blu subtitles versus dvd ==

0.3 off?

how to train dragon DVD srt right on with mplayer DVD 29.97

== mplayer dvdnav  ==

mplayer os x extended has the same "where am I?" on this DVD problem mplayer has.

monsters' inc. plays fine with CCCP+WMP in XP.  No 'where am I?' syndrome.

== avidemux on ripped files ==

my *guess* is that any transcoding will save it, anything else won't :( [bounty is out for it though!]

avidemux barely off lips:
  mencoder -forceidx -oac copy -ovc copy  dvdoutmplayer.mpg -o yo3.mpg is unseekable
  ffmpeg -i dvdoutmplayer.mpg -sameq yo.mpg took forever, grabbed wrong audio track :P

avidemux from all "normal" rips are still off frame-rate wise somehow...

  "wretch" and "me" were visually on, WMP, VLC, VLC on a VLC grab was either on or really really close, mplayer is right on with the DVD

  handbrake file:
    segfault

avidemux on dvdoutmplayer.mpg
  sound right on 1:00:00 wa[a]s lost, looks good.

avidemux on mplayer grab:
  sound ok, lips off
  top C of cast: 156622 01:48:52.449
    
avidemux on VLC grab:
  1:00:00 "once wa[a]s lost" audio, video appears messed up lips [looks like they are really grabbing raw data]
  top C of cast: 156622 01:48:52.449

== AVS vs. avidemux OSOH/attempt fix avidemux ==

  powerproducer has an edit option, seems accurate [!] 59:56.96 transition, audio is on

  AVS
    59:56.981 transition with OSOH.handbrake.m4v
    seems to get the audio right LOL. No frame counts but does seem to have frame accurate seek/timing
    59:56.97 mplayer grab [!]
  
  AviDemux ffmpeg.fulli 59:56.96 without frame adjustment [!] (prolly doesn't even need the fulli, it's just the consistent frames it needs [?])

  mencoder/ffmpeg "save" avidemux without fulli?
    maybe mencoder with -idx is good nuff to fix it for avidemux?

  ffmpeg on OSOH.handbrake.m4v *fail* 12GB, freezes Avidemux, no video VLC
  
  ffmpegifying mplayerraw: no audio in avidemux, same frame: 28650 00:59:57.347
  [mencoder, ffmpeg both maxed out on cpu with no transcoding [?]]
  
  mencodefiying mplayerraw (mpeg -> mpeg): 
    mencoder1 dvdoutmplayer.mpg -o dvdoutmplayer.mencoderified.mpg -forceidx -oac copy -ovc copy
    lots of "1 duplicate frame(s)!"
    unseekable, with jerky video
    
  OSOHhandbrake.m4v
    avidemux:
      00:59:57.130 for  [close but no cigar]
    AVS
      loaded great. transition 59:56.987 
    machete 
      won't open the mkv file

  playing OSOH with mplayer resulted in *one* mpg_demux switching frames message, at the beginning...and yet this means avidemux was hosed?
    I guess so, since its audio was very accurate, it has no video adjust, it is hosed.s
    
  AVS dvdout.7.mpg
    transition: 59:56.994 [appears right on, this is accurate]
    
  mencoderified mpeg fulli:
    had to set frame rate to 24.  Actually that didn't work it was just broke
    audio right on though
    so non editable avidemux
      actually it shouldn't matter, since we just use this internally, and ffmpeg likes it,
      maybe they can only use the original for editing
      assuming it still works to cut it well though...
  
  ffmpegified dvdoutmplayer avidemux (mpeg -> mpeg no transcoding):
    no audio, transition at 86250 00:59:57.347 (exactly same as normal mpeg)
  
  avidemux on mkv raw sintel:
    no video
    
  avs on mkv raw sintel:
    seems to work great, took awhile loading :P
    
  avs on dvdoutmplayer.mpg:
    cannot seek
  
  avs on mencoder.fulli.mpg (of the above):
    cannot seek or play...is this normal? Is it just me?
  
== DVD player versus PC player various times ==

conclusions:
  VLC's are all pretty consistent across platforms/versions
  VLC DVD playback can be 30s off
  mplayers are at the 29.97 offset
    I think mplayer.exe's are pretty consistent across platforms/versions
    smplayer off a tidge, of course, blame on being a GUI
    dumpstream is md5 accurate, length accurate too
  WMP is pretty close, but internally inconsistent by some odd
  powerdvd is pretty close but internally inconsistent by some odd factor.
  mplayer grab seems very consistent, and "correct" (well, when played back with VLC, so loose rating there).
  mencoder didn't grab it all the way? but is md5 accurate, even with dvdnav or without [can disregard]
  VLC grabs it fine
  WMP on handbrake'd is around 29.97 -- couldn't play back the mplayer grab, guessed on the VLC grab
  fulli on handbrake does "save" avidemux [full editable] [unfortunately that's handbrake...]

speeds: ffmpeg: vertex 2 SSD: 105MB/s old HD desktop 58 MB/s

I wonder if mplayer is just a little bit ahead, or internally inconsistent based on poor seeking for GOP's or some odd...it's either right ahead or right on?

appears smplayer is "like a second" or something behind mplayer, and mplayer doesn't quite agree with VLC but is pretty close, and mplayer.exe seems internally consistent.

are all windows GUI wrapper players internally inconsistent, except maybe VLC which is still itself "a tidge off"?

     47 duck
     conclusion: netflix doesn't care about mac versus pc timing-wise
     59 blu ray how apropo
    
     conclusion (based on this compared with the blu-ray): netflix instant seems to match pretty close, within 1s to the blu-ray

 conclusion: netflix varies pretty widely from instance to instance of playing back (same computer, same movie, same browser).

MPlayer git-20100211-1-g1c6846f-Kovensky-mt (C) 2000-2009 MPlayer Team
  can play dvd:// and dvdnav:// with seeking at the beginning without crashing...[because old, maybe?]
  mulder's: http://mulder.googlecode.com/files/MPUI.2010-10-17.Full-Package.exe crashes like normal [dvdnav only]
    smplayers seem to always play dvd:// so never crash [?]

the internet seems to "not tell me" if transcode's avisplit is frame accurate or not.

watching a DVD "from the new DVD ISO" in smplayer seemed to have the right audio always. yep.
  i.e. transcoding from dvd flick fixed it [probably]

previewing section on HP 2 hours or so and the first thing overlapped the muted section in error...went too long...huh?
  call ffmpeg -i C:\HP_AND_THE_CHAMBER_OF_SECRETS_edited_version.fulli_unedited.tmp.mpg -vcodec copy -acodec copy  -ss 7260.0 -t 10.499 C:\HP_AND_THE_CHAMBER_OF_SECRETS_edited_version.1.avi
  call ffmpeg -i C:\HP_AND_THE_CHAMBER_OF_SECRETS_edited_version.fulli_unedited.tmp.mpg -vcodec copy -acodec ac3 -vol 0  -ss 7270.5 -t 1.499 C:\HP_AND_THE_CHAMBER_OF_SECRETS_edited_version.2.avi
  call ffmpeg -i C:\HP_AND_THE_CHAMBER_OF_SECRETS_edited_version.fulli_unedited.tmp.mpg -vcodec copy -acodec copy  -ss 7272.0 -t 3.999 C:\HP_AND_THE_CHAMBER_OF_SECRETS_edited_version.3.avi

  resulted in sectors of 13.17 1.93, 5.03 instead of 10.5, 1.5, and 4. huh?
   with FFmpeg version SVN-r19313, [BAD VERSION probably]
  call ffmpeg -i C:\HP_AND_THE_CHAMBER_OF_SECRETS_edited_version.fulli_unedited.tmp.mpg -vcodec copy -acodec copy  -ss 7260.0 -t 10.499 yo.1.avi
    with r32676 seemed much more sane (!)

$ to fix mplayer out of sync audio:
$ ffmpeg -i HP_AND_THE_CHAMBER_OF_SECRETS_edited_version.fulli_unedited.tmp.mpg -target ntsc-dvd -t 1600 yo.mpg
seemed to be as good as adding a harddup via mplayer.  except...umm...VLC can play it right so why can't mplayer?  Hopefully all doesn't matter [?]

ffmpeg "copy copy" on HP fulli seemed to not have audio when that was replayed via mplayer.

monsters inc. overlaps at 25 minutes, 50'ish, 70, "when they land" and there's like 30 'select scenes' (chapters) in that time frame...

bob "they will come" has no mplayer overlap (45 minutes long)

HP 2 "full and edited version" had a twidge off of audio even in VLC (unsure if that was copy or lavc audio)
  seems consistent
  The DVD (flick) burned, then played, appeared to have audio in perfect sync, always.
  seems to play fine in smplayer
  the fulli version was *totally off* in smplayer
  fulli, edited version had some artifacts in VLC
  fulli version had perfect audio in VLC
  audio looks barely off VLC for the whole thing

mplayer (updated) playing dvd:// (bob) can't seek if past 30 minutes or so (pause/hang)

mplayer (updated) playback, if it ever goes off the screen, chokes and hurles and dies (or if it goes under a window that is always on top).

an edl with (updated mplayer and) dvdnav:// (bob) results in a crash when seeking the first few seconds, at least.

Seeking using the "forward 10, back 10" works in mplayer console, 
  also works (!) with smplayer (+10, back 10).
  
Also edl works *perfectly* when playing from the ripped file.

There is only one break in cars DVD. A:3756
  Is it the same in other large DVD's?
  so certainly, mplayer's edl playback is broken currently, for DVD's.

if I change the mute to 2:13, then it works [!], though probably doubly.

"enable dvd menus" in mplayer doesn't seem to help with seeking weirdness in smplayer

smplayer edl against cars DVD *fails* on later ones (1:05), but succeeds on 15:00, mute-wise.
Like epic fail.
also seeking totally fails:
  58 -> 58 works (cars)
  transition to broken seeking:1:02:44
  also always thinks its chapter 1 :)
  
smplayer playing cars fulli (of some sort) seems to be a split second off, audio-wise

smplayer on HP2 -> edited version (ffmpeg through mencoder) with oac copy, is off by an annoying split second when replayed in smplayer
 at other times, it fails everywhere almost, sync-wise
  that "might" have been with HP and -oac lavc, but without harddup.  or maybe it was -oac copy
  VLC plays the audio splendidly on the same.
  plays well from DVD, though.  Just that one file isn't playable with mplayer...
  how does EDL fit into all of this, though?
  also note that mplayer originally couldn't cut right because of audio (with oac copy, I believe)

ffmpeg said that the huge HP grab was always 48 minute duration [?] (then proceeded to work right)

edl *fails* with HP at the 2 hour mark, audio.  The audio did seem to line up, at least, with their lips.
  and if it's video--fails the same. Seems to think it's at second 2678, or minute 44, not minute 120?

smplayer on bob pets pickle and baby has sync'ed audio with oac copy
  in general, if it starts sync'ed, smplayer stays in sync all the way through
  
got av_interleaved_write_frame(): Operation not permitted
  on call ffmpeg -i C:\HP_AND_THE_CHAMBER_OF_SECRETS_edited_version.fulli_unedited.tmp.mpg -vcodec copy -acodec copy  -'
;?Pss 749.0 -t 4109.999 C:\HP_AND_THE_CHAMBER_OF_SECRETS_edited_version.5.avi
  then it passed (reading off the "old fulli" with poor audio) when did it again. huh?
  out of disk perhaps??
  
edl works *great* with cars at 15 minutes, and appears to at an hour, too.  Oh, and the audio matches perfectly.

The kicker is that if I want to watch the "unedited all" option in mplayer (which I do for the "quick start" mode), then it needs to be as is...

audio_codec = these_settings['audio_codec'] || 'lavc' # not copy...sniff...or you can't hear cars...as ffmpeg loses it on transfer [?] at least the intermediates you *cannot* hear.

HP with edl (only) seriously fails at the 2 hour mark, even with 5 seconds added, or seems to, at least.

windows media player is able to playback the "fulli" that mplayer gets out of sync on (lavc audio), at least with cars.

mplayer dvd://23 -dvd-device e:\ -edl C:\Users\packrd\AppData\Local\Temp\mplayer.temp.edl
  seems to play with audio in sync always, with cars (now with potter...)

what if you grab with "full" audio...does it make its way back out to the DVD? what does dvd flick do audio wise?

without harddup smplayer got audio video out of sync playing DVD, as well as playing ripped files, however
  when you wrote those to DVD, they seemed to get back in sync. ffmpeg, perhaps, is/was fixing them?

fulli with lavc audio and video: mplayer cannot play it back right, but if it's re-encoded with mencoder first [? or is it ffmpeg?], mplayer
seems to play it fine then. Thin ice here...

if I pull from dvd with -acodec lavc (basically downgrade to stereo), then ffmpeg can extract to avi with sound.
  otherwise (cars only), it lacks sound *only on computer players*

Note that mencoder cannot have an endpos on a dvd. Weird.

Note that dvdflick "appears" to encode correctly even if the size is too big, as in it just encodes it "lossy-y"
  The encoding actually appears to be fairly high quality, that dvd flick does, video wise, at least.

ffmpeg -i bigg.mpg -acodec copy -vcodec copy bigg.reindexffmpeg.mpg

resulted in a sound with no audio

I got bigg trying to combine (mencoder ?) two large files.

I think .big has honestly messed up audio, no reindexing seems to help it, at all.
