	a "stand alone box" for people to insert their DVD's into (or maybe that just plays netflix instant "edited" for them? magically)
	  linux box with a DVD player in it? :)
	some software for a PS3, that allows people to "watch the next DVD/blu-ray edited" or to watch something edited natively (from online)
	I wonder if you could "screen capture" the playing movie "sans timestamp" (that is displaying in a background window, or in a different monitor attached)
	  and then display the captured movie onto "the displaying viewport" (projector, fore ground window)
	
    blu-ray OCR
      more blu-ray stuff: can ID them, can playback (through...mkv? VLC? powerdvd OCr/scripted?)
      some blu-ray player descriptor somehow
    accomodate splits vs. blanks and work

   apple TV "mirror" edited content (via overlays or not) to your TV
   netflix instant:
    overlays that are "partial window" overlays, to block pieces of the movie
      or an overlay that is obscuring [pixelating for instance] of pieces of the movie
        same overlay partial windows could be made to "move" over time, or change location, position, size, color, obscuring percentage, etc.
      or so that it can add text over the top of a playing movie [with or without dropshadow]
        the text could be community text
          it could also allow for community comments over a video [for instance text from different previous viewers, or simultaneous viewers]
       it could overlay with "boxes" or other shapes to point out things in the film, for instance "red boxes" to highlight idiosyncracies, with or without accompanying text.
      overlays could be accomplished using native windows, or using a web browser type "insert this over" like  [related: youtube text and bubble overlays] [related: mozilla's popcorn.js over html5 videos]
    also related: http://www.amara.org/en/ [universal subtitles] has a way to super impose text over online videos, probably could be used by us for [text] or obscuring the playback screen, as well. https://github.com/pculture/unisubs [could be nice, popcorn.js possibly better maintained than popcorn is]
    overlay with an alpha transparent image (like circles, etc.) that may or not move over time.  The image knows which pixels should be let through.
    make this into a "pick your own aspect ratio for playing back netflix, etc." program [controls the windows, resizing them appropriately, or screen captures and re-displays that with adjusted scaling for a new aspect ratio/modified playback.]
    some way to "interject" new audio and/or video playback [a la "fan edit"] into a playback, possibly pausing the controller, or diminishing its playback, or volume control, as well, etc.
      
   roku has an api to control playback (like a remote)...use it to control/mute/monitor playback
    a roku app (private channel?) that can somehow receive it edited, like...streaming from your computer.  Actually, I'm in a reasonable position to accomplish this LOL.  Though plugging in a computer's HDMI out cable might be nuff for now...I'd have to meter this once I "go serious" with it.
      intel's broadcast thing (mentioned http://forums.roku.com/viewtopic.php?p=392123&sid=ff1df19a71129a37979934ed540a5349)? desktop to chromecast? chrome to chromecast (youtube API) via chromecast to TV?
      ffmpeg to transcode it (on the fly? HLS?)
    it can project "around" a movie as it's playing, so producer's control the atmosphere around it (viz: MS game atmosphere thing)
    it can add an overlay "gradient" (alpha transparent gradient optionally), and/or text, and/or "pause at this scene for 5 seconds" and/or "at this scene, pause, then insert this other scene from the same movie, or other movies, over it while paused" (or while it continues to play...)
    it can use windows messaging API's to "control" a remote player, viz: http://www.chipmunkav.com/help/appcontroller.htm
    it can "resync" based on audio transcription (or noticing lips move) or on some user input (back, forward buttons to subtly resync edits with a currently playing back video) or
      with user input "tell me where this subtitle is, for you, and also this one" to synchronize it (+- auto-playing to "around" that level so they can check more easily), 
       or you can ask them manually for time entry for the same.
    OCR'ing subtitles on the fly (or, cache'd OCR'ing them on the fly, to give it time to process) to synchronize or check for profanity or other "questionable" content
    
    chromecast has an api, use that (to edit and to stream)
      for google play videos, but also for netflix instant possibly in the future?
    provide a system where (netflix instant or not) you can choose "what to do" in scenes of violence, etc.  mute? skip? overlay? decrease volume? fast forward? several?  depending on intensity, too, etc.
    post a demo of it playing back blu-ray edited local computer, +- projector
	post a demo of it being streamed to (a server/somebody else's computer) using ffmpeg or playon.tv
	some "free edited player" thing, but that also shows ads somehow (pause every so often?)
	can infer a rating based on (looking it upon imdb, letting people vote, etc.)
    I can forsee some browser window that pulls up some sweet player [mod vlc plugin?] somehow something quality anyway, to play local media, or remote
      or same thing but for upconverting...but how?
    could add dragging since we already control the mouse up and down, and movements etc., for example to skip forward etc.
    a little robot demo thingy that can "click" your remote (or hardware) to fast forward through certain scenes, et al
	  EDL can say "this exact text was at this exact time" to allow for matching with other videos of same content that may have slightly different timestamps/speeds/start time etc.
      with several, or start one, end one, etc.
	    allow for extra start time offset for videos, if netflix instant has any
    a way to integrate with cable TV, ex: "this show we know started at 1:01, and its offsets should be this after that point"
    make it so an EDL can be "split" (or subtitles split, same way) so that it can span across multiple youtube videos that have been divided in some way.
    it can query the currently open browser window, check to see which movie it's playing, and auotmatically spawn off a correct player instance with EDL for that movie
      based on title or url.
	when playing a movie, it identifies by colors/tones the movie or the scene, to edit accordingly
	 when there's a profanity mute, to display some extra text on the screen like "and I really want you to be happy!"  I guess it could just be like a transparent overlay on the movie 
    netflix "try this srt, does it match?" no "what about this one, now?"
    it can "infer" where the thumb slider would be, and "drag" it to where it infers the new timestamp location should likely be, for skipping et al.
    people can "vote" on certain sections, if they're profanity or not, should be skipped or not
    overlay one video on another
	You can take a youtube that has been split into '10 minute parts' on youtube, and apply a (longer) EDL to it by splitting it into 10 minute sections.
    I can imagine a system that scans incoming audio, does voice recognition sofware analysis on it, search for (angry tones, profanities, "questionable" tones/text like making love), and excludes them from output [search forward, skip forward, just display nothing, either one, mute audio, decrease audio et al].
    make an API web service that can search for EDL's
	  or with youtube, use the api to fast forwarrd there
	    and if it isn't already loaded, display an extra notice "forwarding" or what not.
		and/or display some other overlay and or audio in place of the video or audio, or supplementing it.
    a video of "recording to broadcast it" (or save it one by one)
    can parse a screenplay et al to look for violence/profanity/sex
      can parse/detect "innuendo" based on natural language semantics, from subtitles et al.
    my own "roku" channel streaming edited content [from somewhere online even, like a remote server that does the editing for ya??]
    can "suck in" a large list of EDL's from imdb at build time, 
      and/or a "resync" button, to re-download just the list of updated EDL's/IMDB wiki settings [?]
    can handle multiple dvdid's et al (same EDL) (mostly done already)
    can "obscure" full frames [sections of frames] and/or "partial" frames or sections of frames (ex: lips, nudity)
    can add extra overlays of text (personalized subtitles, like)
    some tie in with blog posts
      some tie in with google +/facebook for community viewing/editing/realtime collaboration/editing/vieweing.
    track the audio noise level, use that to auto-scan for violence
    use the descriptive captioing audio to discover violent scenes (she says "he hits her" or what not), or for other questionable scenes.
    ratings system, where users can rate based on various criteria/statistics, each EDL, and it aggregates them to display/obtain/use a sum rating metric
    can 'remove' or 'obscure' CC or subtitles deemed offensive
    it can pull in a DVD based just on the dvd-id "query id, not local? go get it from online to see if the list has been updated since"
    control VLC RC to overlay a logo dynamically
    can control volume *and* play other audio
    can permanently black out certain coords to keep things prettier...et al
    remove black when they really move the mouse?
    a transport schema talking from a sensible cinema database "to" a player which uses it, and/or has selection options for levels of (content category) or can pick options they want, stored in sensible cinema database or in the "player" side, with transfer/communication between the two.  Ex: XML as a transport, oauth for authentication, etc. etc.
      or they could transmit a time signature "across the wire" somehow (ex: every second), which could be used to react to time events (skip, mute) appropriately.  Or allow for programatic callbacks "call me at this time" or "at this time do this action" or the like, and/or accomodate for buffers/freezing etc. [kind of already demo'ed this one]
    can add to to supplement EDL + EDL timestamps
    can pick specific profanities to avoid (I think I demo'ed this already actually)
    it can scan "playing" instant streaming titles, and/or OCR or take the audio and look for words, to check for profanity.
      it can examine "output volume level" to auto-detect violence scenes.
      similarly for "questionable" content
      it can detect from subtitles (and/or OCR, same thing), questionable content, or violence, based on words used
    use multiple filters/complex mapping graphs to overlay just the exactly correct overlay: http://ffmpeg.org/libavfilter.html or AviSynth scripts
    user preference "how many down clicks on volume for profanity" (already possible)
    space -> advance from pause until next edit item?
    can jerk mouse only every so often (cheap would be to just arbitrarily have it from x to y, demo that)
    can scan several player descriptors to "pick the right one" (kind of already showed/did this one)
    post some playon.tv demo screencast...this should prove all shouldn't it [?]
    can "control mouse" to drag it to change location (ex: "move down 10 pixels at beginning of movie" LOL)
    beep at them/warn when not tracking [?]
      default on...I think.
    can jerk mouse more often closer to failure sections...
      and/or resize the playing/streaming window to match it when the mouse "has been moved recently" +- by us, or not.
    can pull one from imdb at all, video "show it creates a file"
    C DVD player: minimize instead of skip :P
    don't mute, just almost mute LOL or almost mute and static-ify
      or combine the two
    can suck it in "in realtime" from online, and parse it +- from a user editable wiki
    a UI to select categories, save as preference, apply it each time at DVD selection time
    don't use timecodes, use "% of the movie" and "total length" perhaps?
    look at patents for other ideas? [+- nissim p's?]
    just pause it, tell them how far to fast forward at that point :P [somewhat already done/showed actually, thanks to mplayer]
    
    have the user forced to tell me what each digit is, themselves, at runtime, for OCR :P
    the online edl stuff itself (its todo list)
    javascript API
      phase 1: done
      phase 2: I can accomodate for pausing, too.
      phase 3: I can re-train based on events of stoppage (buffering et al)
      phase 4: I can constantly poll and react appropriately to current timestamp
    post video demo of it streaming to a console device
    maybe could just "play from x to y" [no exclude info?] instead of "here are the bad parts"
    stage one: query, auto-download when they hit a netflix movie of some type
      stage two: chrome plugin for the same, auto-detect, auto-user, auto-download, auto-watch edited :)
    can insert deleted scenes et al [even external scenes :P] (already showed it able to even do this somewhat)
    can overlay with an alpha transparent other video, which video is sped up from its original form.
      or which video is itself edited for content, or displayed with realtime content editing/edited movies.
         it can overlay with enhanced/modified "other video image" files.
      it can overlay audiobooks
        it can overlay it with edited audiobooks/sped up/modified somehow audiobooks
   it can "enhance" movies, like sharpen them, magnify, zoom, et al   
   it can jump/insert a pre-recorded"clean" version of a certain scene.
    
    many others were already completed and done from this list and removed
    there are some more ideas in the TODO file itself, and/or on the blog sites where I have posted other ideas too
   fan editor, that can jump positions within the same DVD/insert audio overlays/insert videos et al
   voice recognition for detection of profanity/violence/etc. etc.
   detect subtitles for "what appears to be suggestive" content or lewd scenes, etc., based on the text, +- natural language processing
   overlay with transparent movies (other movies)
   "double check synchronize" button for making sure the edits line up, with or without text saved of subtitles, et al
   auto-detect "dark scenes" or "skin tones" or "noises" or the like
   can "fast forward" through scary/otherwise questionable scenes
   can auto-compute/compare md5's (using any arbitrary hash function)/truncated md5's/streamline (faster) partial md5's/can md5 specific frames to detect times/to lookup correct EDL's on the fly.
     can use the same or some other mnemonic to download something or to go to some online url for it/related to it.
     can auto-lookup and display things like images/ratings/user reviews, dynamically, about a piece
  can "auto-sync" "this EDL maps to this movie in this other player (hulu, for instance) which has synchronization points x,y, so it adjust the
     timestamps in the EDL accordingly, for that one .
  can work with compressed audio/video, or uncompressed
  can work with encryped data/image/audio data, or unencrypted, with or without 3rd party player/codecs etc.
  can have its "own" metadata stored off somewhere (like user contributed images/photos/comments/blogs/wikis)
    can link videos to adds/adwords/add providers somehow/voice over/overlay adds, et al. 
  can have overlay (+- transparent) of adds/off-screen/below the video, always, or every so often, based on timestamp (fixed, or specific to a video)
    can have overlay text (ex: news ticker, adds, chats, comments from users) on a video.
 integrate with google plus (+- api) somehow, and/or broadcast [?]/realtime "chat" while watching, voice/text, etc.
    google TV too, and apple TV, as an app., etc. etc. (auto-download EDL's etc)
 machine learning for video analysis for synchronization/detection of "questionable scenes/audio" [?]
  can "blank out" or "obscure" certain parts of the screen based on skin color, or region, or region with vectors (moving region), based on timestamp, or pixel color, or hue, or YUV, or combination of the two ("this color in this region, within these time beginnings and endingses")
  can OCR subtitles from DVD's on the fly, to screen them like tvguardian now does.  With or without in an embedded unit.
  Everything else mentioned here, but in an embedded unit/side by side with other things/as an app in a console device.
  people can send you a file and you send it back edited to them LOL (file meaning a rip of some DVD they own, +- requiring them to send in an original DVD too LOL.
  see also business ideas.txt file
  realtime chat while viewing/editing/use google wave
  being able to coordinate/synchronize playing 2 dvd's when you're away
  can display "user contributed" subtitles (edited, fan edit style, etc.)
  can overlay them "transparently" above various players, arbitrarily, by tracking timestamps on screen, etc.
  while synchronized, they can chat, like in a video game LOL
  can overlay an srt file to an "online" OCR tracked player
  right click on DVD "play edit with ..."
  bookmarks within edited playback/remember where you last left off
  you can record the screen of an "edited playback" in order to create an edited version. If legal.
  each EDL can have a "type" specified, like "type a starts at time x, ends at time y" "type b starts at time z, ends at time mu" so that you can re-use the same EDL
    cross several media types.
  EDL action "zoom" to a certain part/portion of a movie, for a specified amount of time.
  during a "tense" scene it can "darken" the scene more, or blur it, or shrink it to a fraction of its original size, or make it faster,
    or turn down volume, or mute.  User preferences to "respond to EDl action type x with reaction y" (where y is blur, mute, skip)
  have jump/jump to file to be able to insert alternate endings.
  an avisynth script to "cut" the file to be able to cut out/mute out sections
  an avisynth script to "cut" the file to be able to watch it playback edited without modifying the original.  +- DVD input too.
  split EDL's based on DVD "title"
    have some menu system for "choose, now, which path you'd like to take" (ex: which alternate ending)
  when parsing a subtitle file, can specify an "extra buffer" to put around all of the subsequent mutes that it calculates for you, based on timestamp.
  scan subtitles for text that "accompanies" violent or sex scenes, edit around those automatically.s
  when playing they are presented with a list of "groups" of items that can be added to their EDL.
    One for profanity, one for boredome, etc.  and can pick and choose, mix and match the ones that they will apply for that viewing.
	  It then adds them together and uses them.
  http://openplayback.blogspot.com/ lists some useful ideas
  Create a system that "receives" for instance netflix instant streams, or DVD streams, or screen casts
    1) edits them, "sends" them back to a client receiver. with or without OCR'ing elements of the screen.
  it can "automatically synchronize" with a list of EDL files contained on some "other server somewhere"
    basically, when it starts, it runs a git update, which brings its local list of EDL's up to date, so it can see any changes.
	This also allows for p2p EDL sharing, since you can have git repositories anywhere, and pull a list of them.
	Another option would be to "always" pull from a/the server when you lookup EDL's for a certain media object (DVD, file, online, etc.)
	then you're always getting the latest/greatest.
  it can have multiple "synchronization points" for various different medias, for example specifying that "in netflix instant, this particular subtitle starts here, where as with dvd's, it starts here, and this ending subtitle is here with netflix instant, here with other media"
  it can have multiple "synchronization points" for coordinating subtitles with the movie, like a beginning, middle, ending point, for better incoordination.
  it can "save" a movie using upscaling/upconversion techniques, so that when it is played back later it can be played back looking good, without requiring more cpu to upscale it "on the fly" at that time.
  "user prompt each time" for sections, like "would you like to skip this section this time around?" per EDL
  upconvert the audio somehow, like adding bass on its way out :)
  it can "insert" video/videos
  it can "loop" just once or always, when it hits a certain timestamp (ex: just loop once to insert a video)
  you can specify an image to "overlay" at "exactly this frame" then a different one for "exactly this one..."
  allow for interaction among users watching a video together (but on separate devices), for instance chat, synchronization,
    they can "circle" things in the playback/insert their own overlays/their own dynamic overlays/their own programmable
    filters that do something to the video before displaying it/interact with ads presented during video playback or
    "while" video is playing back.  Playing games together while the movie is playing. Being able to pause and then "color over"
    parts of the frame, etc.
  it can display a screen/wiki editable something that accompanies a film while it is being viewed, a la: http://www.cnn.com/2012/09/15/showbiz/tv/second-screen-tv-our-mobile-society/index.html
    including online chats with others, etc.
  it can record an online playing movie/video/stream, then replay it back to you "at 1.5 speed" or "beautified/optimized" (or edited), or any combination of the same.
  
  you can adjust as a subtitle file "gets off" with time, you factor in some timing to accomodate for its qwirks, ex: by different phases that re-sync/
  you can "pause and insert audio" at some point (or a separate video, or jump within the same one), then it returns/resumes playing where it left off.
  after I can do netflix instant, also hook it up so that it can mute "pandora songs" too [?] or figure out some way to edit streaming sound as well.

  choose your own adventure type movies :)
  "random play each movie" / "different movie each time through random jumping in a controlled, prescribed manner
  can specify to 'add text/graphics {pictures, circles, etc.}' at such and such a time, at such and such a location
  from http://www.pcnoevil.info/?p=27: an ability to zoom and crop the moving image, so that scenes which may contain objectionable visual content but may be otherwise tolerable can be framed differently. Another feature that I think would be a real plus is the ability to store portions of the audio track of the presentation in memory when the disc loads, in order to later interject them during playback to replace objectionable terms in the dialogue. For instance if a character in a movie says, �great�� at some point, that word could be stored in memory when the disc loads, and when the playback reaches a certain point, the word could be substituted for a curse word.
  can "just play the music" from a movie--put in the DVD, play back its tunes, baby :)
  add an air of randomization, for instance, as to which ending it will be... 
  online player:
    overlay "obscuring/blurring window" by reading the screen underneath, then contorting it somehow.
	or overlay specific image
	  with or without alpha blending techniques in the iamge
	md5 each frame as it comes in (or checksum it) to "know" exactly/precisely what timestamp you're at.  this would work if the resolutions matched...or possibly blur it first/resize it, or just md5 "parts" of it (a diagonal down it).  Then you can know with higher precision which frame you're on.
	  or compare it with several different md5's, taken from different original playbacks, etc.

  chromecast can be controlled via api possible, with an edited film/movie playback? http://semanticmedia.byu.edu/2013/08/youtube-apis-and-googles-new-chromecast.html	  
  xbmc can be controlled via it's EDL's
  smplayer can be controlled via it's (pre-packaged file name based EDL files).
  control the roku so that you can control what it plays back (external control? http://sdkdocs.roku.com/display/sdkdoc/External+Control+Guide and GetInfo perhaps, then simulate button presses, or if possible control it directly? https://github.com/plexinc/roku-client-public/issues/52)

  netflix instant: somehow download sub automatically, then play the movie, then OCR the screen playback to determine exact instant of playback [or OCR the whole thing, to determine where profanities].  Or have a "delayed playback" system that OCR's as you go along, tries to predict profanity/nudity/etc. based on subtitles [or sounds of what's going on?].
    could also download sub, manual synchronize, then translate it/display it back to the user somehow.

  The design, not the idea.

OCR can work on internet or standalone players.
time elapsed "since the timestamp changed" on screen infers the more precise millisecond
you are at, for being able to skip, mute, overlay, apply overlaid transparent image/video more precisely.
You can grab the specific coordinates by precise location, or by iterating over windows, or by relative location to screen coordinates/window coordinates.
You can use the url to infer the title desired.
You can use user preferences to infer how to use each setting within the "EDL" by saving the user preference, and comparing it
against each entry in the EDL when you parse it.

It can mute by clicking a mute button, by accessing an API.
It can work by monitoring, using an API, the current playback time.

It can react to "seek" commands to coordinate position within EDL's.

Another invention: it can apply editing "commands" to a player that is playing back blu-ray discs (hardware or software), as originally described in other clearplay
patents, like US6889383 and those issued to them afterward.

You can get the specific digits by "absolute digit location" or by "OCR on the entire timestamp"

Could also playback using avisynth.

Can create edited files.
