2GB macbook had "295MB free RAM" and played it OK [it's dual core 2009] using 100% of one core LOL.  hmm...


uses 0.25.1

== 1000 fps ==

hard to tell if it uses "much more" or not...

28 to 35 on older desktop 1000 fps

100 fps about 28

1000 fps about 30

modified 29 maybe? LOL inner loop! won't hurt...

nice desktop "new" 1000 fps 14% cpu, so OK... 25% is one core...

== interesting UI's ==

securityseearch had a bouncing up arrow under the chrome "add extension popup"
  "one thing left"
  
  Some appealing first button...

  kalood had a movie
  
== to test ==

does the text show up on an amazon page
can it "survive starting within a skip" 
  (sicario 53:30) (temp audio+video blip OK)
  check5
skip followed by skip -> no intermediate video (audio blip OK for now LOL)
  rogue nation 1:56:00
    https://playitmyway.org/edit_tag/7189 -> https://playitmyway.org/edit_tag/7190
    skip -> skip
      check5
    skip -> yes_audio_no_video (and mute_audio_no_video)
      check5
    yes_audio_no_video -> skip
      check5
    if seek -> heart of skip auto blank
      check4
    seek -> heart of no_video auto blank
      check5
    seek "out of no_video" -> not show bad stuff
      check5
    single seek, normal start -> not black it at all
      check5
    reset them all to skips!

== youtube api terms of us ==

0.06558707820129328

embed requirements:
  can't autostart unless within view, 200x200, if autostart should be immediate, when visible. weird.
  "The YouTube API Services Policies also includes several policies relevant to API Clients that play YouTube audiovisual content. "
  guess I am an "API Client" looks like I'm using "Youtube API Services"
    API Clients must display a link to YouTube's Terms of Service (https://www.youtube.com/t/terms), and they must also state in their own terms of use that, by using those API Clients, users are agreeing to be bound by the YouTube Terms of Service. 
  "YouTube API Services Terms of Service" seem clean
  "YouTube API Services - Required Minimum Functionality" seems clean

modify, build upon, or block any portion or functionality of a YouTube player;
  so overlay is out...yeah probably...
  that's functionality of the *player* not portions of the video FWIW :|
  you can't mess with how the player behaves basically
  except you can turn off controls anyway so...uh...
  
basically, the player needs to "just sit there"
 and I can control it with the embed API
 and that's it.
 so what does the embed API give me...hmm...

could shrink to 200px by 200px (the video that size that is)
  might actually be legal "14.use a video player smaller than the minimum video player size set forth in the YouTube API documentation and specifications."
  it's "smallish" hmm...
  doesn't work in full screen :|
    can't resize full screen, or trivially come out of it? :|

tricky one:
separate, isolate, or modify the audio or video components of any YouTube audiovisual content made available as part of, or in connection with, YouTube API Services. For example, you must not apply alternate audio tracks to videos;
promote separately the audio or video components of any YouTube audiovisual content made available as part of, or in connection with, the YouTube API Services;

OK take the high road uh guess :(((

I *think* I can reliably seek...hmm...
  and phew
  
I could speed things up but...but...just for youtube?  it's baaack LOL
  speed up and mute?

move the screen down then back up?
  it is barely barely iffy unfortunately...they want it visible I guess... [?]
  no :|

Embedded players must have a viewport that is at least 200px by 200px. If the player displays controls, it must be large enough to fully display the controls without shrinking the viewport below the minimum size. We recommend 16:9 players be at least 480 pixels wide and 270 pixels tall.

youtubes "are" 16x9
  so smallest'ish: 200 height, 356 wide
   youtube_pimw_player.setSize(355, 200)
  but if I have my own controls....apparently they can't deny me 200x200
  and I want really as small as possible :|

just do the easy for fun

https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/api-services-terms-of-service
  bring value, don't negatively impact

https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/developer-policies
  promote separately audio and video/background player

amazon small?

word "easy" really big somewhere.

initial driving force "look at all these videos"

   either hope for plugins or...hack their binary [yikes?]
    or ask for them to support it natively [already did'ish...]
