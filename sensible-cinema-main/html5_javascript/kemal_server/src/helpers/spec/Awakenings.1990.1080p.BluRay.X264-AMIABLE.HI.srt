Well, I'm here to apply

00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,829
in your neurology lab.

00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,982
Neurology lab?

00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,585
We have an x-ray room.

66
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:27,701
This is a chronic hospital, doctor.
The position is for staff neurologist.

You will be working with
patients, people. Yes.

- A "doctor" doctor.
- Doctor.

Anything with patients there?

- Earthworms.
- I'm sorry?

71
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,710
It was an immense project.

72
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:46,104
I was to extract one decagram of
myelin from 4 tons of earthworms.

73
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,741
- Really?
- Yes.

74
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,866
I was on that project
for five years.

75
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:54,945
I was the only one who believed in it.
Everyone said it couldn't be done.

76
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,821
- It can't.
- I know that now. I proved it.

77
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:02,261
Maybe before, at St. Thomas?

78
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,822
- All research?
- Oh, yes.

00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:09,105

- Ben, we're totally understaffed.

worked with human beings.

would be wasted here.

- Excuse me. But, uh...

You're clearly looking for someone
with more of a clinical background.

84
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:27,021
As much as I need a job, there must be more
applicants suitable for this position.

85
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:31,028
- Thank you, anyway.
- Dr. Sayer, back in medical school.

86
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:34,741
You couldn't have graduated
without some clinical experience.

87
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,871
You took a pulse, you took a
temperature. You did diagnosis.

- Well, there you have it then.

- SAYER: How do they get well?
- They don't, they're chronic.

102
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,182
- We call this place the Garden.
- Why?

103
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:26,025
Because all we do is
feed and water them.

I see him like he was.

You know, before the stroke.

if I saw anything.

and what they can lose.

is liberation, mania...

- Or love?

What did they say?

They said there was
insufficient data at this time.

1026

That continued observation was
necessary for a complete diagnosis.

and you may not be prepared for it.

They couldn't be held responsible
for what might happen to you.

out of the woods yet.

1034
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:36,511
I'm not sure that this is nothing.

1035
01:28:36,680 --> 01:28:38,350
It's an experimental drug.

1036
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:40,662
We need time to evaluate
things before...

1037
01:28:41,440 --> 01:28:44,191
- Bye.
- Leonard.

1038
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:46,025
Leonard.

1039
01:28:46,280 --> 01:28:49,031
Leonard, where are you going?

1040
01:28:49,080 --> 01:28:50,750
For a walk.

1041
01:28:51,520 --> 01:28:54,351
Leonard. Leonard.

1042
01:28:59,920 --> 01:29:01,260
This is Dr. Sayer.

1043
01:29:01,800 --> 01:29:03,868
<i>WOMAN (ON PA):
Dorquez, please call the pharmacy.</i>

1044
01:29:03,920 --> 01:29:06,341
<i>Miss Dorquez, call the
pharmacy, please.</i>

1045
01:29:12,480 --> 01:29:14,708
- Where are you going?
- I'm going outside.

1046
01:29:14,760 --> 01:29:17,227
No. Patients not allowed
beyond this point.

1047
01:29:17,280 --> 01:29:19,223
- I'm going for a walk.
- No, no. I'm sorry.

1048
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:22,305
Please, don't make
it hard on yourself.

1049
01:29:24,160 --> 01:29:26,945
- ORDERLY: I got him. I got him.
- SAYER: Leonard, stop.

1050
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:30,070
- LEONARD: I just wanna go for a walk.
- SAYER: He's not a mental patient.

1051
01:29:30,120 --> 01:29:33,702
This is unnecessary. Let him go.
Please, he's not violent.

1052
01:29:33,800 --> 01:29:36,346
He's not violent. He is
not a mental patient.

1053
01:29:36,400 --> 01:29:39,788
Will you let go? You will hurt him.
Will you let go of him?

1054
01:29:40,120 --> 01:29:43,463
Will you stop, please?
Let go of him.

1055
01:29:43,840 --> 01:29:48,025
I don't understand it. He was
never any trouble before.

1056
01:29:48,080 --> 01:29:51,582
He was quiet and
polite and respectful.

1057
01:29:51,640 --> 01:29:53,742
He never demanded anything.

1058
01:29:53,800 --> 01:29:55,584
He was never disobedient.

1059
01:29:55,640 --> 01:29:57,981
Because he was
catatonic, Mrs. Lowe.

1060
01:29:59,760 --> 01:30:02,101
I'm speaking of when he was a boy.

1061
01:30:03,840 --> 01:30:05,465
I'm sorry.

1062
01:30:06,240 --> 01:30:08,502
I don't know who that is up there.

1063
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:11,140
I don't think he knows.

1064
01:30:11,640 --> 01:30:14,949
You've turned Leonard
into something he's not.

1065
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:19,583
It's not us that's defective, it's them.
We're not in crisis, they are.

1066
01:30:19,680 --> 01:30:21,350
- Yeah.
- LEONARD: They are.

1067
01:30:21,400 --> 01:30:24,424
We've been through the worst
and survived. They haven't.

1068
01:30:24,520 --> 01:30:27,703
- They fear it. They fear it.
- Right.

1069
01:30:27,760 --> 01:30:30,261
- Because they know.
- MAN 1: They know. They know.

1070
01:30:30,360 --> 01:30:32,462
- They know.
- MAN 2: They know.

1071
01:30:32,520 --> 01:30:34,031
LEONARD: They know, they know

1072
01:30:34,080 --> 01:30:37,787
because we remind them...

1073
01:30:39,440 --> 01:30:42,305
We remind them that
there's a problem...

1074
01:30:42,360 --> 01:30:45,304
There's a problem that they
don't have an answer to.

1075
01:30:45,720 --> 01:30:48,744
And they'll never be healers
until they realize this,

1076
01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:54,350
until they start to see the problem,
until they admit there is a problem.

1077
01:30:54,400 --> 01:30:57,709
And that the problem isn't us.
We're not the problem.

1078
01:30:57,800 --> 01:31:00,062
It's them. They're the problem!

1079
01:31:00,120 --> 01:31:03,667
- It's them!
- They're the problem.

1080
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:05,900
They're the problem.

1081
01:31:05,960 --> 01:31:10,031
MAN 3: They're the problem!
They're the problem! It's them!

1082
01:31:10,080 --> 01:31:12,421
They're the problem!

1083
01:31:15,160 --> 01:31:18,264
He's lived 30 years without
the ability to release anger.

1084
01:31:18,320 --> 01:31:19,581
KAUFMAN: As have the others.

1085
01:31:19,640 --> 01:31:22,505
I think his behavior is more
natural than the others.

1086
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:26,790
Oh, really? His tics, his paranoia,
these are signs of normal behavior?

1087
01:31:26,840 --> 01:31:29,386
- Yeah, because he's in that place.
- Oh, is that it?

1088
01:31:29,440 --> 01:31:32,271
Yes, we wake him up and
then lock him up in a cage.

1089
01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:34,900
That's not paranoia, that's a fact.

1090
01:31:34,960 --> 01:31:38,382
The fact is, I've got 20 psychotics
up there refusing to eat.

1091
01:31:38,440 --> 01:31:41,350
Now, they have no idea why
they're refusing to eat.

1092
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:45,182
- How long should I let that go on?
- He knows why. He wants out.

1093
01:31:45,240 --> 01:31:48,822
Dr. Sayer, Mr. Lowe is not
the messiah of Ward 5.

1094
01:31:48,880 --> 01:31:51,062
He's a man in trouble.

1095
01:31:51,120 --> 01:31:54,224
He wasn't resurrected, he was
administered a drug by you.

1096
01:31:54,320 --> 01:31:57,390
A drug that's fallen short of
its miraculous reputation.

1097
01:31:57,440 --> 01:31:59,668
The others are fine.
They show no signs...

1098
01:31:59,720 --> 01:32:01,549
He's been on it longer, doctor.

1099
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:08,989
Now, I sympathize with him,
I've tried to accommodate him.

1100
01:32:09,080 --> 01:32:12,866
But I will not let him endanger the
health of the rest of the patients.

1101
01:32:18,480 --> 01:32:20,901
SAYER: It will help if you
wait for me out there.

1102
01:32:20,960 --> 01:32:22,471
Thank you.

1103
01:32:23,920 --> 01:32:25,226
Excuse me.

1104
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:27,748
- Excuse me.
- MAN: We can't allow it.

1105
01:32:28,120 --> 01:32:29,984

1106
01:32:33,480 --> 01:32:35,184
He's all right.

1107
01:32:45,800 --> 01:32:47,868
How are you today?

1108
01:32:48,200 --> 01:32:50,826
I'm all right. How are you?

1109
01:32:52,520 --> 01:32:54,031
Never better.

1110
01:32:56,520 --> 01:32:58,588
What's the purpose
of these gentlemen?

1111
01:32:58,640 --> 01:33:02,108
Oh, these gentlemen protect me.

1112
01:33:02,800 --> 01:33:06,109
- I wish I didn't need them.
- Someone's trying to hurt you?

1113
01:33:07,240 --> 01:33:09,104
- Who?
- Who? Heh, heh.

1114
01:33:09,320 --> 01:33:11,787
That's the thing, isn't it? Who?

1115
01:33:12,160 --> 01:33:15,548
One never knows. Someone I
least expect, I expect.

1116
01:33:16,160 --> 01:33:18,103
Look at history.

1117
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:23,105
Leonard, every patient on this ward
thinks there's a plot against him.

1118
01:33:23,360 --> 01:33:25,303
They're mistaken, they're crazy.

me, but I have things to do.

look at yourself.

No, look at yourself.
I have a sickness.

1127
01:33:56,320 --> 01:33:59,981
Sickness took me out of the world,
and I fought to come back.

I fought for 30 years, 30
years, and I'm still fighting.

- But you have no excuse.
- Me?

1130

- Nothing to do with me.
- You have no excuse.

You're just a scared and
lonely man with nothing.

No life, nothing. You're

Your medicine could be taken
away. They can do that.

You could wake up in the
morning and it won't be there.

TYLER: All we're saying is you're
taking an unnecessary risk.

He's had a reaction to the drug.
He has acquired some tics.

But he's not as concerned
with his appearance

as the affect it may have
upon the other patients.

We'll be working with his dosage.

He's aware, and he's
prepared for any effects.

to be prepared as well.

1248
01:44:59,720 --> 01:45:03,984
When my son was born
healthy, I never asked why.

01:45:05,040 --> 01:45:06,630
Why was I so lucky?

This perfect life?

But when he got sick,

1253
01:45:14,720 --> 01:45:18,302
you can bet I asked why,
I demanded to know why.

1254
01:45:18,360 --> 01:45:20,861
Why was this happening?

1255
01:45:23,560 --> 01:45:28,063
There was nothing I could do about it.
No one I could go to and say:

1256

"Stop this. Please, stop this.
Can't you see my son is in pain?"

1257
