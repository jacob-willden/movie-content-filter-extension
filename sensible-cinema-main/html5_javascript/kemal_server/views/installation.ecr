      The <b>Play it My Way</b> app works on desktop/laptop/chromebook computers.  You can even plug your computer into your TV!
      <br/>

      <br/>
      You can also browse our collection and see which movies/TV you'd like to watch edited later, and add them to your <a href=/watchlist>watchlist</a>.
      <br/>
      Browse <a href="/browse/youtubes">edited youtubes</a> or <a href=/>edited movies/TV</a>.
      <br/>
      Just google "play it my way" when you come back tonight on your computer, to install the app and watch movies!
