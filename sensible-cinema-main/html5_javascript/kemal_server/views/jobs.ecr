<h1>Jobs</h1>
<br/>
Want a job that changes the world, ever so slightly?  You've come to the right place.  We're looking for people that are passionate about movies and morals and would love to join our team!
<br/>
We can't offer riches or wealth, but a good feeling, we hope :)
<br/>
We are a "movie filtering" company, which means we add tags to movies to identify the profanity, violence, sex, etc. so that people watching movies can choose to skip that stuff at their discretion when they watch it later.

<h4>Current openings:</h4>
<br/>
<% if currently_hiring?  %>
Editor: $9/hr for 20 to 30 hours per month.
<br/>
Have what it takes to be a movie editor? Detail oriented to help us tag the bad stuff? Not afraid of PG-13 movies? <a href="mailto:rogerdpack@gmail.com?Subject=Pimw%20job%20inquiry">Talk to us, click here!</a>
<br/>
Loving edited movies like cleanflicks/clearplay/vidangel is a plus.  Being any creative major is a plus.  Being a movie fan with great attention to detail is a plus.  Liking movies and being tech savvy is a plug.  Knowledge of "conservative standards" big plus.  Computer skills, internet access, and your own computer/laptop required.  Must be willing to edit at least PG-13 movies (where you replay bad parts over and over to make sure you edited them right).  Shoot us an email! Resume optional but nice.
<br/>
Work is "from your home" and hours are flexible (i.e. really anytime, though we discourage Sunday work), you'd need to be able to commit to at least 20 hours/month, and manage your own schedule.

Volunteer: want to help us make sure we got out all the bad stuff.  We'll pay the rental/prime costs for you to watch videos we have already edited, plus a small stipend per movie!  You'd look for any bad stuff and tell us the time when it is in the movie.

Volunteer:  interested in the cause but don't like the money entanglement? You can join our team and edit movies for us for free, we'd love the help, if you think you have the drive, let's talk! :)
