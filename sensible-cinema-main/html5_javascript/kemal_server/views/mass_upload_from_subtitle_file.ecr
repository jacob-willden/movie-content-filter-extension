<h2>Automatically import from subtitle file <%= url.name %> </h2>
Want to upload a subtitle file and *automatically* detect where profanities are, so you don't have to enter them?  We do that!  Unfortunately it yields "imprecise" mutes that also mute some of the surrounding sentence, but it's still useful.

<br/>
<br/>
<% if url.amazon? %>
since it's amazon, you can get a perfectly synchronized subtitle file "for free."
<br/>
First, start playing your video and turn on subtitles so that they're visible in the movie.  Then reload your browser.  Then click the "subtitle" link:
<br>
<img src=/images/subtitle_link.png width="500px" />
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Then copy that (long, ugly) URL and then paste it here:
<input type="text" name="amazon_subtitle_url" size="100" placeholder="https://cloudfont.../...dfxp" />
<br/>
<br/>
And you're done, the new timings should be perfectly synchronized, though worth watching through and double checking.  Unfortunately they include "the whole sentence" instead of just the profanity so it's worth going back and tightening them later.
<br/>
<% else %>
<br/>Not Amazon: download a subtitle file for your movie from an online site, ex: <a href=http://www.english-subtitles.club/ target=_blank>here</a> and search for your movie name.
<br/>Next, synchronize your file (otherwise mutes will be off by several seconds).  Unzip any .zip file, upload .srt file to <a href=http://subsyncer.appspot.com/step1 target=_blank>in this synchronization tool</a>, then watch your video with CC's on and pause it right when some text appears on the screen.  Enter that current playback time into the synchronization tool.  We recommend entering several "synchronization points", one at the very beginning, one 3/4 of the way through).  If you're editing a youtube, you might be able to download subs from youtube or from somewhere online ??
<br/>This will download a new "synchronized" .srt file for you.  Then upload synchronized .srt file here:
<br/> <input type="file" name="srt_upload" id="srt_upload_id"/>
<% end %>
<br/>
If you need to tweak how it parses input file, you can add extra time to beginning of each mute, here:
<input type="text" name="add_to_beginning" size="10" value="0.0"/>
<br/>
Add extra time to end of each:
<input type="text" name="add_to_end" size="10" value="0.0"/>
<br/>
Note again that this mutes "whole phrases" so you probably want to go back and "tighten" up all the mutes it creates so they are more precise.
<br/>
If you want to "revert" a subtitle upload, manually delete each tag one by one that it created (there is a "show details" link on the movie info page that makes this a little easier), then upload a new subtitle file.
