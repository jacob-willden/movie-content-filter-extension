Translation Kid Hugo

4
02:18,15 --> 02:20,88
Good morning.

5
05:01,36 --> 05:03,43
Finally got you!

6
05:03,43 --> 05:07,79
Not the first time
stealing, right?

7
05:07,79 --> 05:09,42
Empty your pockets.

8
05:09,42 --> 05:11,06
You're hurting me!

9
05:11,07 --> 05:17,00
Empty pockets
or call the guard!

10
05:26,26 --> 05:29,73
What are you doing
with all this?

11
05:30,15 --> 05:32,66
- Empty the other.
- There's nothing in it.

12
05:32,66 --> 05:36,71
Call the guard!

13
06:27,75 --> 06:30,34
Ghosts.

14
06:31,88 --> 06:36,08
You drew this?

15
06:36,08 --> 06:39,34
It was you who designed it?

16
06:41,10 --> 06:43,12
Where stole it?

17
06:43,12 --> 06:45,00
Do not steal.

18
06:45,00 --> 06:47,47
A thief and a liar.
Get out of here.

19
06:48,05 --> 06:52,94
- Give me my book!
- No longer yours, is mine!

20
06:52,94 --> 06:56,71
- No!
- So tell me who drew!

21
07:00,83 --> 07:03,92
Get lost you thief!

22
07:05,65 --> 07:09,12
Why are you still here?
Go away!

23
07:09,12 --> 07:14,02
You hear that?
Then go back!

24
07:18,22 --> 07:20,32
Excuse me! Excuse me!

25
07:23,38 --> 07:25,61
Excuse me!
Police passing by!

26
07:34,58 --> 07:36,68
Excuse me!

27
08:01,04 --> 08:03,14
What?

28
08:25,67 --> 08:27,77
Nothing to see here.

29
08:36,11 --> 08:38,43
Stop that boy!

30
08:40,11 --> 08:42,97
Hey! Stop!

31
09:10,71 --> 09:13,24
[da..]!

32
09:15,72 --> 09:18,73
Stop the train! Stop!

33
09:18,73 --> 09:21,08
Help!

34
09:21,08 --> 09:24,84
Stop the train!

35
09:25,51 --> 09:28,44
Make it stop!

36
11:22,83 --> 11:26,53
Sorry, sorry!

37
11:29,60 --> 11:32,44
No, no!

38
12:49,70 --> 12:54,36
The Invention of Hugo Cabret

39
12:59,99 --> 13:05,27
I know it's there.

40
13:07,37 --> 13:09,68
What is your name?

41
13:10,52 --> 13:14,29
Hugo. Hugo Cabret.

42
13:14,29 --> 13:17,03
Stay away from me
Hugo Cabret.

43
13:17,03 --> 13:21,28
Or I'll take you to the police station
station,

44
13:21,66 --> 13:26,64
put him in prison
where you will not leave,

45
13:26,64 --> 13:31,64
not going to school
will never marry, have children,

46
13:31,64 --> 13:34,86
to pick up stuff
they do not own.

47
13:35,53 --> 13:38,19
Give me back my notebook.

48
13:39,27 --> 13:42,67
I'll take your book to
home and burn it.

49
13:51,47 --> 13:55,75
- You can not burn it!
- And who's gonna stop me?

50
15:27,25 --> 15:29,08
How are you?

51
15:29,08 --> 15:33,01
- Very angry.
- Why?

52
15:33,02 --> 15:35,24
A boy ...

53
16:00,57 --> 16:02,37
Who are you?

54
16:02,37 --> 16:04,31
His grandfather stole my book.

55
16:04,31 --> 16:06,96
You need to take back
before it burns.

56
16:06,96 --> 16:09,59
Papa George is my grandfather!

57
16:09,59 --> 16:11,79
And not a thief, that is you!

58
16:11,79 --> 16:17,48
You are nothing but
an immoral.

59
16:19,54 --> 16:23,47
- You need to go.
- I'm not going without my notebook.

60
16:24,92 --> 16:27,98
Why do you need him?

61
16:28,47 --> 16:31,14
I can not tell.

62
16:32,61 --> 16:34,89
It's a secret?

63
16:34,89 --> 16:38,02
- It is.
- Great, I love secrets!

64
16:38,02 --> 16:40,03
- Tell me what it is.
- No!

65
16:40,03 --> 16:42,99
If you do not tell me, go away.

66
16:42,99 --> 16:45,48
Not without my book!

67
16:46,13 --> 16:48,52
We'll be in trouble.

68
16:48,52 --> 16:50,95
Go home!

69
16:58,99 --> 17:04,22
Okay, do not let
burn the book.

70
17:04,47 --> 17:07,16
Now go away!

71
17:55,71 --> 17:57,44
What is this?

72
17:57,44 --> 18:01,89
- It's called 'robot'.
- A robot?

73
18:01,89 --> 18:05,85
Was abandoned
in the attic of the museum.

74
18:08,23 --> 18:10,44
What does it do?

75
18:10,44 --> 18:14,49
He is like a
music box.

76
18:14,59 --> 18:20,56
It's more complicated
I've seen ... so far.

77
18:24,72 --> 18:28,64
It can write.

78
18:30,64 --> 18:33,22
But it was not done
in London.

79
18:33,22 --> 18:35,54
And where is it?

80
18:36,18 --> 18:39,75
And Coventry, but
was built in London.

81
18:39,75 --> 18:42,73
Magic used machines as well
when I was little.

82
18:42,73 --> 18:45,20
Some walked,
others sang,

83
18:45,20 --> 18:51,12
but the secret was always
the heart. Look at that.

84
18:56,04 --> 19:00,29
- Can we fix it?
- I do not know, Hugo.

85
19:01,16 --> 19:03,34
He is very rusty.

86
19:03,35 --> 19:07,26
Find the right parts
will be very difficult.

87
19:09,64 --> 19:11,96
But it is clear that
let's fix it.

88
19:12,56 --> 19:15,10
We are clockmakers, is not it?

89
19:15,10 --> 19:18,56
But I must finish my
work in the shop and museum.

90
19:18,57 --> 19:21,47
You understand.

91
19:26,28 --> 19:29,63
Hold carefully.

92
19:33,25 --> 19:35,37
Perfect.

93
19:44,06 --> 19:46,40
You see this?

94
19:46,64 --> 19:49,60
Another complication.

95
19:49,61 --> 19:52,14
Another mystery.

96
19:52,14 --> 19:55,23
This makes you happy?

97
19:55,41 --> 19:58,34
A lock of the form
of heart.

98
19:58,34 --> 20:01,18
Unfortunately,
we do not have the key.

99
21:09,35 --> 21:11,92
I fixed the gears ...

100
21:15,08 --> 21:17,18
Uncle Claude?

101
21:21,56 --> 21:26,45
There was a fire.
His father is dead.

102
21:34,91 --> 21:39,33
Pack your bags, fast.
You will live with me.

103
21:43,67 --> 21:45,77
Quick!

104
21:54,26 --> 21:58,26
You will be my apprentice, and will
live with me at the station.

105
21:58,26 --> 22:02,04
I will teach you
to take care of everything.

106
22:06,46 --> 22:10,90
These apartments are
made inside the station.

107
22:12,86 --> 22:16,31
All forgotten
we're here.

108
22:20,17 --> 22:23,49
His bed is in the corner.

109
22:24,41 --> 22:28,76
Get some sleep.
We will start work at 5am.

110
22:33,32 --> 22:35,18
What about school?

111
22:35,18 --> 22:37,76
No more school!

112
22:37,76 --> 22:42,09
You will not have time for it
when working.

113
22:45,07 --> 22:47,85
Hugo ...

114
22:47,85 --> 22:52,04
you would be in the
orphanage without me.

115
22:59,53 --> 23:03,56
Time ... Time is ...

116
23:03,56 --> 23:06,36
60 seconds of one minute.

117
23:06,36 --> 23:10,85
Gives 1 hour 60 minutes.

118
23:11,82 --> 23:15,15
Timing is everything.

119
23:17,97 --> 23:21,75
Time, time ...

120
23:58,01 --> 24:00,45
Stop!

121
24:00,45 --> 24:02,61
Stop it!

122
24:02,61 --> 24:04,78
No, no, no!

123
25:12,08 --> 25:16,58
Good day!

124
25:19,00 --> 25:22,54
Good morning, sir,
I help you?

125
26:03,98 --> 26:07,17
I thought I would see today.

126
26:11,44 --> 26:14,32
I need my notebook.

127
26:15,59 --> 26:18,19
Why do you need?

128
26:19,31 --> 26:24,14
To help me fix
one thing.

129
27:05,17 --> 27:07,44
Go away.

130
27:08,89 --> 27:11,48
Please, go away.

131
27:18,52 --> 27:20,14
Wait!

132
27:20,14 --> 27:22,88
Sorry, I ...

133
27:22,88 --> 27:27,08
Are you crying?

134
27:27,40 --> 27:30,08
- No.
- Stand still.

135
27:30,36 --> 27:34,03
Pronto. There is nothing
wrong with crying.

136
27:34,03 --> 27:38,23
Sydney Carton cries,
and Heathcliff.

137
27:38,23 --> 27:41,42
I can clean.

138
27:41,42 --> 27:45,99
I need to talk with you.
It is very important, but ...

139
27:45,99 --> 27:49,56
But not here.
We are very ...

140
27:50,53 --> 27:53,04
exposed.

141
27:54,79 --> 27:57,48
- Come on.
- Where are we going?

142
27:57,48 --> 28:00,55
The most wonderful place
the world.

143
28:00,55 --> 28:04,87
It's like Neverland
or Treasure Island.

144
28:05,15 --> 28:07,38
You'll like it.

145
28:07,38 --> 28:09,03
Isabelle ...

146
28:09,03 --> 28:12,08
I present to you
Mr. Hugo Cabret,

147
28:12,08 --> 28:16,12
an old and dear friend.

148
28:19,99 --> 28:22,26
Mr. Cabret.

149
28:23,70 --> 28:26,49
Hello

150
28:27,62 --> 28:29,72
Thanks for that.

151
28:29,72 --> 28:33,14
I'm not even half
than David Copperfield does.

152
28:33,14 --> 28:36,63
- Photography?
- That corner.

153
28:36,63 --> 28:40,16
- Upper shelf.
- Thank you.

154
28:47,94 --> 28:51,61
- Listen, what is so important?
- He still has his notebook.

155
28:51,61 --> 28:54,40
He did not burn,
was a trick.

156
28:54,40 --> 28:58,01
- Why?
- I do not know.

157
28:58,01 --> 29:00,95
Just know that the book
left very upset.

158
29:00,96 --> 29:04,63
He and Mama were Jeanne
up late talking.

159
29:07,30 --> 29:10,17
I think he cried.

160
29:13,67 --> 29:16,39
Why are you helping me?

161
29:16,64 --> 29:20,66
Because it can be
an adventure!

162
29:20,66 --> 29:23,24
And I never had one like that.

163
29:23,90 --> 29:26,48
Off the books, at least.

164
29:26,49 --> 29:30,45
And I think
will be quite ...

165
29:32,53 --> 29:34,90
Illegal!

166
29:37,52 --> 29:39,67
Okay.

167
29:39,67 --> 29:43,73
Incidentally, my name is Isabelle.
Whether a book?

168
29:43,73 --> 29:48,24
Monsieur Labisse lends me,
It also lends to you.

169
29:50,05 --> 29:53,55
Do not like books?

170
29:53,89 --> 29:56,40
I like it.

171
29:57,40 --> 30:01,19
My father and I read
many stories together.

172
30:08,93 --> 30:11,62
Come on.

173
30:12,30 --> 30:14,42
How do I recover
my notebook?

174
30:14,42 --> 30:17,09
I think you should
face it.

175
30:17,09 --> 30:21,26
And do not talk that talk.
I will help you as you can.

176
30:21,26 --> 30:24,45
Be strong for us.

177
30:30,70 --> 30:33,31
Go away.

178
30:51,85 --> 30:54,38
Fix it.

179
30:56,11 --> 30:58,46
Get that fixed.

180
31:01,58 --> 31:04,96
I know who has stolen
tools.

181
31:05,26 --> 31:08,70
Use those that have not robbed.

182
32:08,05 --> 32:09,94
Give me back the book.

183
32:09,94 --> 32:12,95
You have talent.

184
32:12,95 --> 32:16,11
If I prove that it is
more than a thief,

185
32:16,11 --> 32:20,12
- Have your notebook back.
- How?

186
32:20,12 --> 32:24,58
Work here to pay
stole everything.

187
32:24,58 --> 32:30,57
And I'll decide when to return
the notebook, if you return.

188
32:31,10 --> 32:34,90
- I already have work.
- Stealing is not working.

189
32:34,90 --> 32:37,15
I have a different job.

190
32:37,15 --> 32:40,28
I'll come when you can.

191
32:41,85 --> 32:44,85
You start tomorrow.
Go away.

192
32:46,35 --> 32:48,85
I'll start now.

193
32:56,01 --> 32:58,80
That is not, is another.

194
33:55,08 --> 33:57,47
It is your letter?

195
35:32,84 --> 35:36,05
Where is it?

196
36:19,05 --> 36:22,63
Little Man ...

197
36:28,88 --> 36:32,07
- He fled the orphanage, right?
- Do not run away!

198
36:32,07 --> 36:34,09
You have parents?

199
36:34,09 --> 36:35,92
No!

200
36:35,92 --> 36:39,89
Excellent, then place
is at the orphanage, right?

201
36:39,89 --> 36:43,60
Why were you looking
the lunch that man?

202
36:43,60 --> 36:48,97
It was his? Age?

203
36:48,97 --> 36:51,77
Here is Gustav talking.

204
36:51,77 --> 36:54,76
Yes, sir, not always.

205
36:54,76 --> 36:57,61
This time it was stolen
and invasion.

206
36:57,61 --> 37:00,88
His hand was encroaching
the paper bag

207
37:00,88 --> 37:04,01
to remove its contents.

208
37:04,80 --> 37:09,63
What had in
bag? A loaf of bread.

209
37:11,08 --> 37:13,32
Be quiet!

210
37:13,32 --> 37:17,23
Nobody sent
do that crimezinho

211
37:17,23 --> 37:20,26
with their dirty little hands.

212
37:21,62 --> 37:26,42
Of course I'm not talking
with you. I respect him.

213
37:26,42 --> 37:30,42
There was a comment
about his wife?

214
37:31,09 --> 37:35,15
This is absurd.
I heard no rumor.

215
37:35,15 --> 37:40,07
I did not know that. With
sure she will return.

216
37:40,35 --> 37:42,30
Come on!

217
37:42,30 --> 37:46,65
I was stealing a loaf of bread!
Your thief!

218
37:47,30 --> 37:49,41
I am sorry for his wife.

219
37:49,41 --> 37:52,11
You can not do
nothing about ...

220
37:53,48 --> 37:56,48
Come here!

221
37:56,86 --> 37:59,47
Pig!

222
37:59,47 --> 38:01,82
What? I do not know what to do.

223
38:01,82 --> 38:05,77
Of course it's your fault.
Who else?

224
38:05,77 --> 38:09,92
Of course it's yours. When
were close last?

225
38:09,92 --> 38:12,97
- Last year?
- I think not.

226
38:12,97 --> 38:14,85
Very suspicious.

227
38:14,85 --> 38:16,59
If you see her, please ...

228
38:16,59 --> 38:18,62
Do you really want her back?

229
38:18,62 --> 38:21,40
Yes, I do. I love her dearly.

230
38:37,46 --> 38:42,49
Robin Hood, I saw the movie.
With Douglas Fairbanks.

231
38:42,49 --> 38:46,12
- Have you seen?
- I've never seen a movie.

232
38:46,45 --> 38:48,91
- What?
- Is not it strange?

233
38:48,91 --> 38:51,84
You've never seen
a movie? Nunquinha?

234
38:51,84 --> 38:56,15
Pope leaves no Georges.
He is very strict.

235
38:56,15 --> 38:57,74
I love movies.

236
38:57,74 --> 39:00,33
My father took me
on my birthday.

237
39:04,89 --> 39:07,17
Hugo ...

238
39:07,88 --> 39:10,80
his father died?

239
39:10,93 --> 39:13,83
I do not want to talk about it.

240
39:24,11 --> 39:26,25
Isabel.

241
39:30,10 --> 39:33,30
Want an adventure?

242
39:39,73 --> 39:43,62
[dumb] FILM FESTIVAL

243
40:00,94 --> 40:03,28
We'll be in trouble.

244
40:04,92 --> 40:07,68
I thought I wanted adventure.

245
40:53,56 --> 40:56,41
As the two mice
get in here?

246
41:01,77 --> 41:04,71
I never
see them here!

247
41:08,76 --> 41:11,49
Why George Pope
do not let it go to the movies?

248
41:11,49 --> 41:14,51
I do not know, he never
said nothing.

249
41:14,51 --> 41:17,47
My father did not leave.

250
41:17,77 --> 41:19,96
What happened to him?

251
41:21,09 --> 41:24,71
He died,
when I was little.

252
41:24,71 --> 41:29,53
Papa and Mama Jeanne Georges
are my [vain use]parents.

253
41:29,53 --> 41:31,37
They are very
with all legal ...

254
41:31,37 --> 41:33,76
least in movies.

255
41:33,76 --> 41:36,24
My father took me
the movies all the time.

256
41:36,24 --> 41:39,14
He told me about
the first one he saw.

257
41:39,14 --> 41:44,90
He entered a dark room
and, on the screen, saw a rocket fly

258
41:44,90 --> 41:47,61
to the eye of the moon

259
41:47,61 --> 41:49,60
That's right.

260
41:49,60 --> 41:53,27
He took me to the movies
at midday.

261
41:54,39 --> 41:57,51
The film was our
special place.

262
41:57,51 --> 42:01,36
It was where I could see something.

263
42:03,76 --> 42:06,68
I never met my mother as well.

264
42:07,23 --> 42:11,07
You think much of him, right?

265
42:11,97 --> 42:14,77
All the time.

266
42:15,34 --> 42:18,63
Hugo ...

267
42:19,11 --> 42:22,12
Where do you live?

268
42:34,25 --> 42:36,35
There.

269
42:39,94 --> 42:42,86
My uncle taught me
to operate all

270
42:42,86 --> 42:45,37
I continue to do so.

271
42:45,37 --> 42:49,30
Perhaps he will return one day.
??But I doubt it.

272
42:49,30 --> 42:52,93
Not afraid
anyone knows?

273
42:52,93 --> 42:56,85
Not while watches
work and nobody sees me.

274
43:01,15 --> 43:03,22
Act naturally.

275
43:03,22 --> 43:06,20
- What?
- Walk, act naturally.

276
43:06,20 --> 43:09,42
How am I doing now?

277
43:22,40 --> 43:25,97
You, stop!

278
43:25,97 --> 43:29,34
Come here.

279
43:32,40 --> 43:36,17
- Good morning, Monsieur.
- Where are your parents?

280
43:36,18 --> 43:39,39
I live with Papa Georges,
the workshop.

281
43:39,39 --> 43:41,73
You should now
have seen me there.

282
43:41,73 --> 43:45,12
And this is my cousin
the field. Hugo.

283
44:00,13 --> 44:05,79
You need to forgive him.
It is small mind.

284
44:05,79 --> 44:10,07
It is rather stupid.
Poor baby.

285
44:19,66 --> 44:23,92
It seems that Maximilian
do not like your clothes.

286
44:23,93 --> 44:27,53
He is troubled
with his physiognomy.

287
44:27,53 --> 44:31,15
He's angry
with his face.

288
44:31,15 --> 44:35,60
Why does not he like
of his face?

289
44:37,64 --> 44:42,54
Perhaps it makes sense
the smell of my cat.

290
44:44,30 --> 44:46,14
- Cat?
- Yes

291
44:46,14 --> 44:50,02
Christina Rossetti.
Is the name of a poet.

292
44:50,02 --> 44:52,48
Want to hear?

293
44:52,48 --> 44:55,12
My heart is a
Bird singing

294
44:55,12 --> 44:57,67
Whose nest is a
offspring dewy

295
44:57,67 --> 45:00,17
My heart is an apple tree

296
45:00,17 --> 45:02,68
Bending the trunk
fruit weight

297
45:02,68 --> 45:07,18
Enough, I've had poetry
enough today.

298
45:07,18 --> 45:12,11
Well, take good care of
Christina ...

299
45:12,11 --> 45:15,40
- Rossetti.
- It's one of my favorites.

300
45:15,40 --> 45:20,04
I know it's Rossetti.

301
45:20,04 --> 45:23,46
But the season is not
place for poetry.

302
45:23,46 --> 45:28,15
Here is the place to go
and out of trains.

303
45:28,57 --> 45:32,19
And working in workshops.
Understood?

304
45:32,19 --> 45:36,05
- Yes, sir.
- Be careful where you walk.

305
45:36,05 --> 45:38,24
Carry on.

306
45:49,44 --> 45:51,54
[idiot]!

307
45:52,36 --> 45:55,46
Since I saved his life.

308
45:55,47 --> 45:58,84
Why do not I see your muquifo?

309
45:58,84 --> 46:04,31
- My what?
- Where do you live. Your home.

310
46:08,75 --> 46:11,48
I gotta go, I
things to do.

311
46:11,48 --> 46:16,92
Wait! Have you seen my house
I can not see her?

312
46:16,93 --> 46:19,33
I'm your only friend!

313
46:19,33 --> 46:21,36
It is not.

314
46:21,36 --> 46:24,01
Being enigmatic
does not suit you.

315
46:24,01 --> 46:25,40
What are you up to?

316
46:25,40 --> 46:29,39
I have to go,
you should not even be here.

317
46:50,57 --> 46:52,67
Hugo!

318
47:11,10 --> 47:13,35
Where did you get that?

319
47:13,55 --> 47:16,89
- It will not matter.
- I need her.

320
47:16,90 --> 47:20,14
- For what?
- I have to.

321
47:22,07 --> 47:25,37
Only if you tell me why.

322
47:30,75 --> 47:32,85
Come on.

323
47:40,86 --> 47:42,92
Incredible!

324
47:42,92 --> 47:45,57
It's like Jean Valjean.

325
47:55,11 --> 47:58,37
This is fantastic.

326
48:05,37 --> 48:08,47
What is this?

327
48:08,74 --> 48:11,16
It's a robot.

328
48:11,61 --> 48:16,22
My father was fixing
before dying.

329
48:26,06 --> 48:30,72
Why is my key fit
his father's machine?

330
48:35,43 --> 48:41,32
He looks sad.
I think he's waiting.

331
48:42,31 --> 48:44,85
For what?

332
48:45,24 --> 48:47,94
To work again.

333
48:49,86 --> 48:53,18
This is not what it
supposed to do?

334
48:54,99 --> 48:58,44
What happens if I connect it?

335
49:00,24 --> 49:02,62
I do not know.

336
49:18,47 --> 49:21,08
What is the problem?

337
49:24,88 --> 49:27,95
I know that's silly.

338
49:31,82 --> 49:35,74
But I think we have
a message from my father.

339
52:17,61 --> 52:21,02
I am a fool
because he thought he could fix it!

340
52:25,06 --> 52:28,83
It's broken!
Always broke!

341
52:39,71 --> 52:44,00
Hugo does not have to
look like, you can fix it.

342
52:44,00 --> 52:47,71
You do not understand.

343
52:48,28 --> 52:50,93
I thought ...

344
52:51,73 --> 52:56,80
I thought if I could fix it,
would not be so alone.

345
53:05,37 --> 53:07,22
Hugo ...

346
53:07,22 --> 53:12,42
Hugo, look!
Not finished yet!

347
53:22,60 --> 53:24,89
He does not write,

348
53:24,89 --> 53:27,57
it draws!

349
54:05,45 --> 54:08,28
It's the movie
My father watched.

350
54:49,08 --> 54:52,39
Georges M li s?

351
54:52,39 --> 54:55,52
Is the name of Papa Georges.

352
54:56,46 --> 55:02,44
Why does your machine
parent sign it?

353
55:03,85 --> 55:06,70
I do not know.

354
55:19,38 --> 55:22,10
Thank you.

355
55:23,97 --> 55:26,78
It was a message from my father.

356
55:27,18 --> 55:31,13
Now we need to find
the meaning.

357
55:45,92 --> 55:48,50
Isabelle?

358
55:50,97 --> 55:53,98
Mama Jeanne, yes.
We need to talk.

359
55:56,27 --> 55:59,00
This is Hugo Cabret.

360
55:59,35 --> 56:02,07
Good evening, ma'am.

361
56:05,68 --> 56:09,65
Manners for a thief.

362
56:09,95 --> 56:12,37
I am not a thief.

363
56:19,37 --> 56:21,15
What's going on, Isabelle?

364
56:21,15 --> 56:26,02
It is a very long history.
Remember a few weeks ago ...

365
56:26,02 --> 56:28,12
Wait!

366
56:58,76 --> 57:02,18
Poor ...

367
57:02,18 --> 57:06,66
Where did you get this?

368
57:08,01 --> 57:09,91
You will call me
a liar.

369
57:09,91 --> 57:12,83
No, boy.

370
57:13,90 --> 57:16,88
A robot designed.

371
57:16,88 --> 57:18,57
You're with him?

372
57:18,57 --> 57:21,74
My father found
the museum.

373
57:21,74 --> 57:24,41
Nobody wanted him.

374
57:24,41 --> 57:27,37
We fix it.

375
57:27,37 --> 57:30,55
But need to ...

376
57:31,51 --> 57:34,80
My key.

377
57:37,07 --> 57:38,95
I gave you?

378
57:38,95 --> 57:40,56
No, no, mama ...

379
57:40,56 --> 57:44,95
Take it! I can not
see it now.

380
57:44,96 --> 57:47,52
Do not let George Pope
see it.

381
57:47,52 --> 57:48,96
Tell us what's going on.

382
57:48,96 --> 57:51,51
It does not matter!
Let's forget it.

383
57:51,51 --> 57:54,64
My father and I work
hard to fix it.

384
57:54,64 --> 57:57,97
That was all
I had left it.

385
57:57,97 --> 58:01,59
I need to know
what it means.

386
58:01,59 --> 58:04,32
Please.

387
58:06,20 --> 58:10,08
You're too young to
understand some things.

388
58:11,32 --> 58:15,04
You should not
knowing sadness.

389
58:17,55 --> 58:21,52
- Is the Pope Georges.
- He can not see it here.

390
58:24,89 --> 58:26,65
Stay silent.

391
58:26,65 --> 58:29,29
I'll find a way
to take him upstairs.

392
58:30,28 --> 58:32,83
Do not want to hear a peep.

393
58:37,77 --> 58:40,11
She looked at the closet.

394
58:40,11 --> 58:43,63
I've tried the notebook there.

395
58:44,53 --> 58:48,18
I'll look again.
Keep an eye out.

396
58:48,18 --> 58:50,84
Great.

397
58:55,35 --> 58:58,99
I'll find a way
to take him upstairs.

398
59:00,87 --> 59:03,63
Do not want to hear a peep.

399
59:07,69 --> 59:10,12
She looked at the closet.

400
59:10,43 --> 59:13,46
I've tried the notebook there.

401
59:13,46 --> 59:17,89
I'll look again.
Keep an eye out.

402
59:17,89 --> 59:20,23
Great.

403
59:57,49 --> 59:59,83
Here!

404
1:00:06,15 --> 1:00:09,16
We need to investigate.

405
1:00:11,14 --> 1:00:13,72
Let me, I'm taller.

406
1:02:17,94 --> 1:02:21,05
Back from the dead ...

407
1:02:25,84 --> 1:02:28,26
Stop! It's your job!

408
1:02:29,66 --> 1:02:35,64
It is not! It is the job
a broken toy!

409
1:02:39,11 --> 1:02:42,09
I trusted you.

410
1:02:44,91 --> 1:02:48,73
This is how you thank me?

411
1:02:52,91 --> 1:02:56,24
You are cruel.

412
1:02:57,91 --> 1:03:00,88
Cruel!

413
1:03:30,07 --> 1:03:33,28
I better get back.

414
1:03:49,82 --> 1:03:52,42
Thank you ...

415
1:03:53,44 --> 1:03:56,40
the film today.

416
1:03:57,38 --> 1:04:00,66
It was a gift.

417
1:04:21,65 --> 1:04:24,98
Excuse me, I ...

418
1:04:32,34 --> 1:04:35,97
Do you know this book?

419
1:04:36,17 --> 1:04:40,38
My father and I read together.

420
1:04:44,55 --> 1:04:49,74
This was for my grandson.

421
1:04:51,53 --> 1:04:56,23
But now I think is

422
1:04:56,23 --> 1:05:00,93
to you, sir. Cabret.

423
1:05:19,20 --> 1:05:20,66
Would you like another cup?

424
1:05:20,66 --> 1:05:23,88
Not yet, soon.

425
1:05:24,50 --> 1:05:30,43
Everything must happen
in due course.

426
1:05:31,80 --> 1:05:36,11
If I knew how,
would have done.

427
1:05:36,11 --> 1:05:41,54
Gustav, be brave.
Say 'hello' to her.

428
1:05:43,01 --> 1:05:46,82
Give me your best smile.

429
1:05:52,32 --> 1:05:55,39
Your best smile!

430
1:05:58,96 --> 1:06:01,67
It's beautiful.

431
1:06:02,12 --> 1:06:04,45
Radiant!

432
1:06:05,64 --> 1:06:08,69
Thank you.

433
1:06:33,78 --> 1:06:35,79
Mademoiselle Lisette,

434
1:06:35,80 --> 1:06:39,28
a good night to you.

435
1:06:40,91 --> 1:06:43,20
You also inspector.

436
1:06:47,48 --> 1:06:49,58
Yes ..

437
1:06:50,12 --> 1:06:53,59
These roses are beautiful.

438
1:06:53,59 --> 1:06:57,87
Thank you. They are of Bordeaux.

439
1:06:57,87 --> 1:07:01,41
They come on the night train,
then they are very fresh.

440
1:07:01,41 --> 1:07:05,59
Bordeaux has clean fields.

441
1:07:05,80 --> 1:07:08,49
No past ...

442
1:07:11,24 --> 1:07:13,72
No limitations ...

443
1:07:13,72 --> 1:07:16,97
Carts everywhere.

444
1:07:16,97 --> 1:07:20,63
A perfect place.

445
1:07:22,09 --> 1:07:26,93
They smell?

446
1:07:27,55 --> 1:07:30,01
The flowers smell?

447
1:07:31,48 --> 1:07:35,86
Yes, they did. Please.

448
1:07:56,57 --> 1:07:59,95
I was wounded in the war
and will never be cured.

449
1:07:59,95 --> 1:08:02,48
Good evening, mademoiselle.

450
1:08:04,04 --> 1:08:06,97
I lost my brother.

451
1:08:11,09 --> 1:08:14,05
Where?

452
1:08:14,05 --> 1:08:16,30
Verdun.

453
1:08:35,36 --> 1:08:38,51
Good evening, sir. Inspector.

454
1:08:41,44 --> 1:08:44,52
Good evening,
Mademoiselle Lisette.

455
1:09:00,20 --> 1:09:03,80
The Library
Film Academy.

456
1:09:04,17 --> 1:09:06,56
How?

457
1:09:06,56 --> 1:09:10,55
The Library
Film Academy.

458
1:09:10,55 --> 1:09:15,49
There you will find everything
you want to know about movies.

459
1:09:15,49 --> 1:09:21,00
Second floor,
fourth row, section 3 ...

460
1:09:21,00 --> 1:09:24,91
and top shelf.

461
1:09:28,46 --> 1:09:32,13
The Invention of Dreams.

462
1:09:34,71 --> 1:09:38,10
Ren Tabard.

463
1:09:38,10 --> 1:09:43,11
The story of the first
movies.

464
1:09:47,57 --> 1:09:51,43
'In 1995, one of the first
films shown

465
1:09:51,43 --> 1:09:55,18
was called 'A Train
Arriving at the station, '

466
1:09:55,18 --> 1:09:59,67
that was nothing but
than a train coming.

467
1:10:03,30 --> 1:10:06,11
As the train sped
toward the screen,

468
1:10:06,11 --> 1:10:08,21
the crowd shouted.

469
1:10:08,21 --> 1:10:12,58
Because they thought
would be hit.

470
1:10:13,68 --> 1:10:18,31
No one had ever seen
nothing like that. '

471
1:10:21,86 --> 1:10:26,55
'No one had ever seen
nothing like that. '

472
1:10:31,96 --> 1:10:35,99
'So that movie
turned into something else,

473
1:10:35,99 --> 1:10:37,94
when the first
filmmakers discovered

474
1:10:37,94 --> 1:10:42,23
they could use the new media
to tell stories. '

475
1:11:24,31 --> 1:11:27,97
'The filmmaker Georges Melies

476
1:11:27,97 --> 1:11:31,94
was one of the first
to realize

477
1:11:33,40 --> 1:11:39,33
films that had the power
dreams of playing. '

478
1:11:40,81 --> 1:11:45,78
'The great pioneer of
died in cinema ...

479
1:11:46,97 --> 1:11:49,73
the Great War. '

480
1:11:50,11 --> 1:11:52,39
He died?

481
1:11:53,05 --> 1:11:57,07
- During the Great War?
- They are interested in M li s?

482
1:11:58,89 --> 1:12:01,51
We are.

483
1:12:03,03 --> 1:12:05,77
Is allowed.

484
1:12:06,00 --> 1:12:08,49
Really?

485
1:12:21,31 --> 1:12:27,28
He is my [vain use]father. It is
very much alive. Thank you.

486
1:12:30,18 --> 1:12:34,96
But this is not possible.

487
1:12:35,34 --> 1:12:40,30
Yes, sir,
believe me.

488
1:12:41,14 --> 1:12:44,11
Why should I
believe?

489
1:12:45,86 --> 1:12:48,50
Because ...

490
1:12:48,69 --> 1:12:52,04
Because it's true.

491
1:12:53,43 --> 1:12:56,79
M li s is alive?

492
1:13:10,64 --> 1:13:12,74
Come with me.

493
1:13:18,24 --> 1:13:22,59
Her [vain use]father
a passion of mine.

494
1:13:22,91 --> 1:13:25,43
He was a great filmmaker.

495
1:13:25,43 --> 1:13:28,51
This is it working
in the studio.

496
1:13:28,89 --> 1:13:34,08
And this is a flyer
Part of it.

497
1:13:34,63 --> 1:13:38,01
This is the mysterious clock,

498
1:13:38,01 --> 1:13:41,73
made by his mentor,
Hubert Hudain.

499
1:13:43,22 --> 1:13:48,44
And this is a
the camera from him.

500
1:13:52,59 --> 1:13:57,38
- It was magic?
- Yes, got on stage.

501
1:13:57,96 --> 1:14:00,89
How it started
making films?

502
1:14:00,89 --> 1:14:03,28
I do not know.

503
1:14:04,47 --> 1:14:08,27
See how happy he was.

504
1:14:08,27 --> 1:14:12,17
Teacher Tabard,

505
1:14:12,17 --> 1:14:16,36
you want
you know it?

506
1:14:18,38 --> 1:14:24,19
See, I already knew.

507
1:14:25,69 --> 1:14:30,05
My brother worked
building sets for him.

508
1:14:30,05 --> 1:14:33,09
One day he took me
to visit the studio.

509
1:14:33,09 --> 1:14:38,13
It was like a dream.

510
1:14:39,20 --> 1:14:42,39
Every place
was made of glass.

511
1:14:42,39 --> 1:14:46,36
That gave the necessary light
for the film,

512
1:14:46,36 --> 1:14:52,33
but for me it was a
enchanted castle.

513
1:14:54,84 --> 1:14:58,47
A palace made of glass.

514
1:15:28,21 --> 1:15:31,18
You have a lobster in front ...

515
1:15:46,84 --> 1:15:51,24
If you ever wonder
where they come from your dreams,

516
1:15:52,02 --> 1:15:54,29
look around.

517
1:15:57,18 --> 1:16:00,09
Here is where they are made.

518
1:16:02,28 --> 1:16:05,44
Ladies and gentlemen,
the music will start.

519
1:16:05,44 --> 1:16:07,94
Fish and lobsters
in position.

520
1:16:07,94 --> 1:16:10,93
Mermaids in position. Action!

521
1:16:20,92 --> 1:16:24,36
He came to do
more than 500 films.

522
1:16:24,73 --> 1:16:27,97
It was very popular
at that time.

523
1:16:28,25 --> 1:16:32,46
But why stop?

524
1:16:32,46 --> 1:16:36,64
Until today, I believe that
he died in the war.

525
1:16:37,04 --> 1:16:39,55
How many others.

526
1:16:41,23 --> 1:16:43,96
We watch
some films?

527
1:16:43,96 --> 1:16:45,89
I wish so,

528
1:16:45,89 --> 1:16:49,86
but time does not
was generous with them.

529
1:16:54,78 --> 1:16:58,73
This is the only
who survived.

530
1:16:59,32 --> 1:17:03,13
Hundreds, only one.

531
1:17:05,03 --> 1:17:08,46
Still ...

532
1:17:09,77 --> 1:17:12,90
is a work of art.

533
1:17:15,53 --> 1:17:18,48
We have to show the movie
Pope Georges.

534
1:17:18,48 --> 1:17:21,05
So he will see
that has not been forgotten.

535
1:17:22,24 --> 1:17:24,51
Must not tell
Mama Jeanne?

536
1:17:25,19 --> 1:17:30,42
No one should be surprised,
like a magic trick.

537
1:17:32,20 --> 1:17:36,86
We need to have class.

538
1:17:38,42 --> 1:17:42,37
Very well.

539
1:17:58,47 --> 1:18:01,21
Monsieur Claude?

540
1:18:01,21 --> 1:18:04,10
It's up there?

541
1:18:04,83 --> 1:18:07,36
It is you, monsieur Claude?

542
1:18:07,36 --> 1:18:10,76
Still
drunk in this life?

543
1:18:10,77 --> 1:18:13,99
You can not
or hold a bottle, right?

544
1:18:13,99 --> 1:18:15,93
Are you listening?

545
1:18:15,93 --> 1:18:20,16
He's drunk?

546
1:18:20,91 --> 1:18:23,82
He's drunk, no?

547
1:18:23,82 --> 1:18:27,25
You [idiot]!

548
1:18:28,04 --> 1:18:30,31
It could have hit
a child.

549
1:18:51,84 --> 1:18:54,49
Monsieur gave me Labisse
a book.

550
1:18:54,49 --> 1:18:56,80
He always does that.

551
1:18:56,80 --> 1:19:02,51
Send books for good
home. That is what he says.

552
1:19:02,51 --> 1:19:08,25
He has a purpose.

553
1:19:09,11 --> 1:19:11,22
How so?

554
1:19:11,22 --> 1:19:14,56
Everything has a purpose
to the machines.

555
1:19:14,56 --> 1:19:18,88
Clocks tell the time,
trains carry you.

556
1:19:18,88 --> 1:19:21,06
They do
they should do.

557
1:19:21,06 --> 1:19:23,47
As Monsieur Labisse.

558
1:19:25,04 --> 1:19:28,86
Perhaps for this reason that machines
broken make me sad.

559
1:19:28,86 --> 1:19:31,73
They are not
what to do.

560
1:19:31,73 --> 1:19:34,28
Maybe it's the same
with people.

561
1:19:34,28 --> 1:19:39,82
If you lose your way,
is like breaking.

562
1:19:41,07 --> 1:19:44,47
As Papa Georges.

563
1:19:44,47 --> 1:19:46,58
Maybe we can
fix it.

564
1:19:47,32 --> 1:19:51,79
This is your purpose?
Fix things?

565
1:19:52,70 --> 1:19:57,27
I do not know.
It was what my father did.

566
1:19:58,41 --> 1:20:02,02
I wonder what is
my purpose.

567
1:20:03,83 --> 1:20:06,14
I do not know.

568
1:20:07,00 --> 1:20:10,77
Maybe if I knew
my parents,

569
1:20:13,06 --> 1:20:15,42
I know.

570
1:20:22,06 --> 1:20:24,16
Come with me.

571
1:20:31,08 --> 1:20:36,28
Soon after my father died,
I came here a lot.

572
1:20:37,78 --> 1:20:42,48
I imagined that the world
was a huge machine.

573
1:20:44,26 --> 1:20:47,63
Machines do not have
with extra parts.

574
1:20:48,01 --> 1:20:52,09
They always come
with the exact amount.

575
1:20:52,28 --> 1:20:56,57
If the world
is a single machine,

576
1:20:58,43 --> 1:21:01,17
I could not be
an extra part,

577
1:21:01,17 --> 1:21:04,81
I have a reason
to be here.

578
1:21:07,07 --> 1:21:10,80
Then you also have.

579
1:21:26,32 --> 1:21:29,24
Go back.

580
1:21:31,62 --> 1:21:33,98
I'll bring Tabard
tomorrow at 19h.

581
1:21:33,98 --> 1:21:36,59
Do not speak.

582
1:21:37,26 --> 1:21:40,27
Are you sure?

583
1:21:40,96 --> 1:21:43,88
Not a lot.

584
1:21:44,08 --> 1:21:48,28
But I think
is the only way ...

585
1:21:49,16 --> 1:21:51,59
To fix it.

586
1:23:41,36 --> 1:23:44,99
Cabret AND CHILDREN
Watchmaker

587
1:23:55,02 --> 1:23:58,18
Stop the train!
It has a kid on track!

588
1:23:58,18 --> 1:24:00,93
Come on!

589
1:24:08,25 --> 1:24:10,82
Get out!

590
1:26:47,70 --> 1:26:52,01
It is an employee
maintenance, ma'am.

591
1:26:52,20 --> 1:26:54,58
In the Seine?

592
1:26:54,58 --> 1:26:57,92
Dead. Are you sure?

593
1:27:01,39 --> 1:27:05,05
No, he had relatives.

594
1:27:05,71 --> 1:27:11,18
Thanks, I'll pick up
his belongings. Thank you.

595
1:27:19,30 --> 1:27:22,68
If he is dead,

596
1:27:22,94 --> 1:27:27,66
who has repaired
clocks?

597
1:27:44,62 --> 1:27:48,26
- Good evening.
- This way, sir.

598
1:27:51,97 --> 1:27:55,09
I got it.

599
1:28:00,20 --> 1:28:04,11
What a surprise! Get in!

600
1:28:06,51 --> 1:28:09,31
Isabelle, what is it?

601
1:28:12,41 --> 1:28:14,23
Do not get mad, mama.

602
1:28:14,23 --> 1:28:18,31
This young
is not welcome here.

603
1:28:22,17 --> 1:28:26,45
We found
Who is George Pope.

604
1:28:28,48 --> 1:28:32,13
I'm sorry, ma'am.
I thought I was waiting for us.

605
1:28:32,13 --> 1:28:35,30
I'm going
and only come back if you ask.

606
1:28:35,30 --> 1:28:37,94
Please speak low.

607
1:28:37,94 --> 1:28:41,40
Georges is sleeping,
not been well since ...

608
1:28:41,75 --> 1:28:46,37
- Mama, do not go away.
- No disrespect, ma'am,

609
1:28:46,38 --> 1:28:49,93
but if not a good time
to find it,

610
1:28:49,93 --> 1:28:52,63
please
let me express

611
1:28:52,63 --> 1:28:56,93
gratitude to such
I have to her husband.

612
1:28:58,35 --> 1:29:02,49
When I was young
I saw all his films.

613
1:29:03,20 --> 1:29:05,91
They have inspired me.

614
1:29:05,91 --> 1:29:09,88
Her husband
is a great artist.

615
1:29:18,67 --> 1:29:24,54
I am very happy that remember
of his films with so much love.

616
1:29:28,18 --> 1:29:31,51
But he is too frail.

617
1:29:31,81 --> 1:29:35,52
It hurts him
remembering the past.

618
1:29:37,63 --> 1:29:41,11
So I leave you, lady.

619
1:29:43,28 --> 1:29:46,75
Forgive me for saying this ...

620
1:29:48,12 --> 1:29:53,19
You look so lovely now
as it was in the movies.

621
1:29:53,49 --> 1:29:58,27
Mama?
You were in the movies?

622
1:29:58,27 --> 1:30:01,35
She appeared
in almost everyone.

623
1:30:01,35 --> 1:30:03,66
You were an actress?

624
1:30:05,94 --> 1:30:09,22
It was a long time.

625
1:30:10,82 --> 1:30:13,32
It was another time.

626
1:30:15,26 --> 1:30:17,76
I was someone else.

627
1:30:19,29 --> 1:30:22,65
I would like to rediscover
this person?

628
1:30:24,63 --> 1:30:27,16
We have a movie.

629
1:30:28,48 --> 1:30:31,38
One of the films of Georges?

630
1:30:31,38 --> 1:30:34,07
It is not possible
they were.

631
1:30:34,07 --> 1:30:36,62
Can I show you.

632
1:30:36,62 --> 1:30:40,45
Please! Please, mama!

633
1:30:46,30 --> 1:30:48,42
Observe silence.

634
1:30:51,38 --> 1:30:56,01
You were an actress, really!
It's awesome!

635
1:30:56,01 --> 1:31:00,85
It was not so. It was not
a star like today.

636
1:31:03,74 --> 1:31:06,72
But we had fun.

637
1:31:10,54 --> 1:31:13,35
Lady M li s.

638
1:32:04,21 --> 1:32:06,01
It has color!

639
1:32:06,01 --> 1:32:11,79
Of course! The paint film.
The hand. Frame by frame.

640
1:32:25,70 --> 1:32:28,19
Are you, Mama!

641
1:32:31,45 --> 1:32:33,84
Yes.

642
1:33:01,37 --> 1:33:04,10
Wonderful.

643
1:33:19,82 --> 1:33:22,14
You were beautiful.

644
1:33:22,59 --> 1:33:25,82
She still is.

645
1:33:44,70 --> 1:33:47,85
I recognize the sound

646
1:33:47,85 --> 1:33:51,29
a projector
anywhere.

647
1:33:57,44 --> 1:34:00,19
Georges ...

648
1:34:00,81 --> 1:34:05,19
You tried to forget the past
for a long time ...

649
1:34:07,43 --> 1:34:10,80
But that only you
brought sadness.

650
1:34:12,42 --> 1:34:16,00
Maybe it's time
to remember.

651
1:34:28,24 --> 1:34:31,12
You know what?

652
1:34:33,57 --> 1:34:36,17
I want to.

653
1:34:39,07 --> 1:34:42,19
Like you,

654
1:34:42,19 --> 1:34:45,61
I loved
fix things.

655
1:34:48,41 --> 1:34:51,68
I started as a magician.

656
1:34:51,94 --> 1:34:54,76
Mama Jeanne
was my assistant.

657
1:35:07,92 --> 1:35:12,21
We did very successfully,
filled the theater.

658
1:35:39,15 --> 1:35:43,34
I was always surrounded
machines in my workshop,

659
1:35:43,35 --> 1:35:47,26
where I invented
new illusions.

660
1:35:47,51 --> 1:35:50,64
Once I built a robot.

661
1:35:52,74 --> 1:35:58,18
It was a particular treasure
I put in my soul.

662
1:36:02,09 --> 1:36:07,95
One night, me and Mama Jeanne
went to visit a traveling circus.

663
1:36:08,58 --> 1:36:13,88
We were passing through the stage
when I noticed something wrong.

664
1:36:13,88 --> 1:36:18,23
Something strange. Wonderful.

665
1:36:25,70 --> 1:36:30,10
The Lumi re brothers had
invented the cinema.

666
1:36:43,79 --> 1:36:47,12
I fell in love
for that invention.

667
1:36:47,12 --> 1:36:50,93
It seemed a new type
of magic.

668
1:36:52,35 --> 1:36:55,41
I asked the brothers
I sold a camera,

669
1:36:55,41 --> 1:36:58,10
but they refused,

670
1:36:58,10 --> 1:37:02,87
because they did not see
future in cinema.

671
1:37:02,87 --> 1:37:07,37
In the end, build
my own camera,

672
1:37:07,37 --> 1:37:10,64
with parts that had
left of the robot.

673
1:37:10,65 --> 1:37:14,29
I needed to be part
this new wonder.

674
1:37:15,23 --> 1:37:19,81
We risk everything
sell the theater and everything else

675
1:37:19,81 --> 1:37:23,67
we build up our
own film studio.

676
1:37:29,40 --> 1:37:31,88
It was a great invention.

677
1:37:41,03 --> 1:37:44,43
I wrote, planned, directed

678
1:37:44,43 --> 1:37:47,87
and worked on hundreds
of films.

679
1:37:47,87 --> 1:37:50,24
Action

680
1:38:21,72 --> 1:38:23,21
Stop, stop, stop!

681
1:38:23,22 --> 1:38:26,46
Give me ten minutes,
will be okay.

682
1:38:30,44 --> 1:38:33,95
Here, here.

683
1:38:33,95 --> 1:38:36,74
If you pull the lever
left, it will work.

684
1:38:38,52 --> 1:38:40,42
Great, great!

685
1:38:40,42 --> 1:38:44,22
Go back to your positions!

686
1:38:47,29 --> 1:38:49,51
Action!

687
1:39:05,86 --> 1:39:07,64
Action! Action!

688
1:39:07,64 --> 1:39:10,77
Stay tuned! Attack!

689
1:39:14,21 --> 1:39:16,31
Attacking and killing!

690
1:39:23,88 --> 1:39:27,28
That, move.
Do the choreography.

691
1:39:29,57 --> 1:39:33,52
One, 3, 2, 1 ...

692
1:39:34,26 --> 1:39:36,76
It was great.

693
1:39:36,76 --> 1:39:42,40
Do not move, people.
Come on, folks.

694
1:39:45,85 --> 1:39:47,95
Action!

695
1:39:52,59 --> 1:39:56,98
Magic tricks and illusions
were my specialty.

696
1:39:56,98 --> 1:40:01,05
The world of imagination.

697
1:40:08,91 --> 1:40:11,89
My beautiful wife
was my muse.

698
1:40:12,22 --> 1:40:14,23
My Star.

699
1:40:14,23 --> 1:40:16,67
And we could not be
happier.

700
1:40:16,67 --> 1:40:18,77
Action!

701
1:40:28,66 --> 1:40:31,09
We never
would end ...

702
1:40:38,14 --> 1:40:40,77
But then came the war.

703
1:40:41,95 --> 1:40:44,94
And youth
came to an end.

704
1:40:47,93 --> 1:40:53,14
The world did not have time
for magic tricks.

705
1:40:53,82 --> 1:40:57,98
The soldiers had seen
much reality

706
1:40:57,98 --> 1:41:00,72
they were bored
with my movies.

707
1:41:00,72 --> 1:41:05,98
Tastes have changed,
but I have not changed with them.

708
1:41:07,53 --> 1:41:10,57
Nobody else
I wanted my films.

709
1:41:11,91 --> 1:41:14,85
So I could not
pay the actors

710
1:41:14,85 --> 1:41:17,45
or continue with the business.

711
1:41:18,09 --> 1:41:21,35
So my castle
enchanted collapsed.

712
1:41:21,61 --> 1:41:23,81
Everything was lost.

713
1:41:24,68 --> 1:41:27,38
One night, in desperation,

714
1:41:28,84 --> 1:41:32,43
I burned all the clothes
and scenarios.

715
1:41:45,26 --> 1:41:47,87
I was forced to sell
my films to a company

716
1:41:47,87 --> 1:41:51,30
the melting
to chemicals,

717
1:41:54,11 --> 1:41:57,70
that were used
to make high heels.

718
1:42:02,62 --> 1:42:07,17
With the money left,
opened the workshop of toys,

719
1:42:09,46 --> 1:42:12,46
and that was where I was.

720
1:42:14,78 --> 1:42:19,79
Just could not destroy
my dear robot,

721
1:42:21,95 --> 1:42:26,45
so I gave it to a museum
to give him a home.

722
1:42:27,20 --> 1:42:29,06
But do not put
on display.

723
1:42:29,06 --> 1:42:34,30
Then he burned the museum
and everything is gone.

724
1:42:34,30 --> 1:42:37,44
All I had was gone,

725
1:42:37,44 --> 1:42:41,20
now only ashes remained.

726
1:42:44,19 --> 1:42:50,12
My life has taught me a lesson,
but I wanted to learn.

727
1:42:50,94 --> 1:42:55,10
Happy endings only happen
in the movies.

728
1:42:58,49 --> 1:43:01,11
I'll be back!

729
1:43:29,02 --> 1:43:31,99
Do not panic!

730
1:43:34,39 --> 1:43:36,49
What does he have?

731
1:44:04,20 --> 1:44:07,16
My dear ...

732
1:44:27,64 --> 1:44:29,21
Gentlemen.

733
1:44:29,21 --> 1:44:33,28
Let me tell you
what happened.

734
1:44:33,28 --> 1:44:34,68
What happened?

735
1:44:34,68 --> 1:44:39,14
Mr. know. Claude?
He was found dead.

736
1:44:39,97 --> 1:44:42,65
- No!
- Monsieur Claude?

737
1:44:42,65 --> 1:44:46,04
So he may not continue
working on the clock.

738
1:44:46,04 --> 1:44:48,29
You came back!

739
1:44:48,29 --> 1:44:50,49
- Hi
- Hello

740
1:44:50,49 --> 1:44:53,40
Mr.. Claude is dead.

741
1:44:54,92 --> 1:44:59,57
What? Why?
What happened to him?

742
1:44:59,57 --> 1:45:02,17
They found his body
the Seine.

743
1:45:02,17 --> 1:45:04,89
It seems that there is
a few months ago.

744
1:45:10,98 --> 1:45:12,58
I would not say that ...

745
1:45:12,58 --> 1:45:15,08
Yes, he was a drunk!

746
1:45:15,08 --> 1:45:17,70
Go away ...

747
1:45:25,27 --> 1:45:26,92
Let me go!

748
1:45:26,92 --> 1:45:29,46
- He thought he was going to fool me!
- Let go of me!

749
1:45:29,46 --> 1:45:32,18
Please help me!

750
1:45:36,11 --> 1:45:38,39
Please!

751
1:45:38,40 --> 1:45:41,35
He's winding me
too long!

752
1:45:44,31 --> 1:45:45,87
Drop the boy!

753
1:45:45,87 --> 1:45:51,79
- Give me a break!
- I need to go!

754
1:45:51,79 --> 1:45:54,12
Only when their parents
you seek!

755
1:45:54,12 --> 1:45:55,45
I have no parents!

756
1:45:55,45 --> 1:45:57,79
Then go to the orphanage!

757
1:45:58,63 --> 1:46:02,43
Will learn some
things there. I've learned.

758
1:46:02,43 --> 1:46:05,33
How to obey orders,
how to keep secrets.

759
1:46:05,33 --> 1:46:07,64
How to Survive
no family.

760
1:46:07,64 --> 1:46:11,93
Because nobody
need it.

761
1:46:14,86 --> 1:46:19,60
The headquarters, please.
Yes, it's me again.

762
1:46:19,80 --> 1:46:21,69
Another orphan.

763
1:46:21,69 --> 1:46:24,08
It was a full week.

764
1:46:24,39 --> 1:46:28,48
Invasion, robbery,
theft, roam,

765
1:46:28,48 --> 1:46:32,61
play, eat ...
It's irrelevant!

766
1:46:32,61 --> 1:46:35,23
Send someone to fetch him.

767
1:46:35,23 --> 1:46:37,52
How are you?

768
1:46:37,53 --> 1:46:42,18
She returned?
Do you think is yours?

769
1:46:42,18 --> 1:46:43,71
Excellent!

770
1:46:43,71 --> 1:46:46,92
You will find
in a few months.

771
1:46:48,30 --> 1:46:50,43
Something else?

772
1:46:50,44 --> 1:46:54,52
I'll try to go. I do not plan
well in advance.

773
1:46:54,53 --> 1:46:56,92
Are you sure?

774
1:46:57,16 --> 1:47:02,01
Well, I do not know what to do
with this ...

775
1:47:03,05 --> 1:47:05,71
Wait a minute!

776
1:47:13,26 --> 1:47:15,36
Get it!

777
1:47:19,41 --> 1:47:21,97
Excuse me!

778
1:47:22,47 --> 1:47:24,58
Out of the way!

779
1:48:19,52 --> 1:48:22,62
It does not have to
escape, boy!

780
1:48:41,86 --> 1:48:44,81
307, 308, 309 ...

781
1:49:59,00 --> 1:50:02,60
He went to
other hand, come on!

782
1:51:06,40 --> 1:51:08,80
Get out of my way!

783
1:51:11,04 --> 1:51:13,36
Gotcha!

784
1:51:45,40 --> 1:51:48,47
There's a boy!
Stop the train!

785
1:52:04,00 --> 1:52:06,90
Back! Back!

786
1:52:06,90 --> 1:52:09,31
What were you thinking?
Are you hurt?

787
1:52:10,21 --> 1:52:12,31
Come on!

788
1:52:12,45 --> 1:52:14,56
Excuse me!

789
1:52:17,43 --> 1:52:20,98
- The orphanage will take care of you.
- I do not live there.

790
1:52:20,98 --> 1:52:23,60
So where do you live?
Have to live somewhere.

791
1:52:23,60 --> 1:52:28,11
Hear me, please!
You do not understand!

792
1:52:28,11 --> 1:52:30,35
You need to let me go!

793
1:52:30,35 --> 1:52:35,78
I do not understand
why my father died.

794
1:52:36,35 --> 1:52:38,73
Why am I lonely.

795
1:52:39,91 --> 1:52:45,19
This is my only chance
to work.

796
1:52:47,25 --> 1:52:50,29
You should understand!

797
1:52:55,60 --> 1:52:57,70
I understand!

798
1:53:00,14 --> 1:53:02,56
I understand.

799
1:53:05,59 --> 1:53:07,79
Monsieur ...

800
1:53:10,26 --> 1:53:13,24
This boy belongs to me.

801
1:53:32,74 --> 1:53:35,39
Sorry, it broke.

802
1:53:35,39 --> 1:53:38,90
There is no!

803
1:53:40,53 --> 1:53:43,63
It works perfectly!

804
1:54:08,92 --> 1:54:13,22
And I'm proud
of welcome

805
1:54:13,22 --> 1:54:18,47
the celebration of life and work
Georges M li s.

806
1:54:24,12 --> 1:54:26,48
For years, most
of his films

807
1:54:26,48 --> 1:54:28,27
appeared to have been lost.

808
1:54:28,27 --> 1:54:31,91
Mr. himself. M li s
believed that,

809
1:54:32,27 --> 1:54:34,58
but we begin a search,

810
1:54:34,58 --> 1:54:40,33
a safe, private collections
cellars and catacombs.

811
1:54:41,42 --> 1:54:44,92
Our work was rewarded
with old negatives,

812
1:54:44,92 --> 1:54:50,13
boxes of pictures
and suitcases full of movies,

813
1:54:50,13 --> 1:54:52,69
we can save.

814
1:54:52,69 --> 1:54:57,29
Now we have over 80 movies
Georges M li s.

815
1:55:02,43 --> 1:55:07,83
Tonight, their creator,
and the new member of the academy,

816
1:55:07,83 --> 1:55:12,21
is here to share them
with you.

817
1:55:47,11 --> 1:55:51,82
Ladies and gentlemen, I ...

818
1:56:01,69 --> 1:56:05,31
I am here in front
you today

819
1:56:06,30 --> 1:56:10,04
because of a girl
very brave.

820
1:56:12,39 --> 1:56:17,46
He saw a broken machine

821
1:56:20,14 --> 1:56:24,53
and, against all odds,
he fixed it.

822
1:56:27,05 --> 1:56:30,35
It was the magic trick
kinder

823
1:56:31,53 --> 1:56:35,00
I've seen.

824
1:56:42,07 --> 1:56:44,27
And now ...

825
1:56:44,27 --> 1:56:47,96
My friends,
I call them so,

826
1:56:47,96 --> 1:56:51,94
as they really are.

827
1:56:52,80 --> 1:56:55,45
Magi.

828
1:56:55,96 --> 1:56:58,39
Sirens.

829
1:56:58,39 --> 1:57:01,39
Travelers. Adventurers.

830
1:57:02,30 --> 1:57:05,23
Magicians.

831
1:57:11,60 --> 1:57:16,21
Come dream with me.

832
1:59:06,75 --> 1:59:09,98
The study of the history of cinema
should start with that.

833
1:59:10,62 --> 1:59:13,03
With photography.

834
1:59:15,27 --> 1:59:17,98
Canine Socialization ...

835
1:59:27,00 --> 1:59:28,99
Smile, honey.

836
1:59:28,99 --> 1:59:31,63
I can not remember how.

837
1:59:33,36 --> 1:59:37,50
See, now it works
perfectly.

838
1:59:49,06 --> 1:59:54,79
One day, I met a boy
named Hugo Cabret.

839
1:59:55,83 --> 1:59:58,74
He lived in
a train station.

840
1:59:58,74 --> 2:00:04,26
Why did he live there?
You must be wondering.

841
2:00:05,03 --> 2:00:08,97
It's about this
this book will be.

842
2:00:09,25 --> 2:00:13,53
