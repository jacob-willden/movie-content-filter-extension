Collection of utilities to make ruby ...more friendly from the get-go [really things that *should* have been added to core, because of immense convenience]

Currently this includes:

require_rel glob
  * require a file relative to the current file, i.e.
  >> require_rel 'lib/filename'

Object#in?
 # ex:
 >> 3.in? [1,2,3]
 => true
  
println
 like print, but with a carriage return at the end:
 >> println 1,2,3
 (prints 123\n)

enumerable-extra
  #new enumerable #map
  >> [1,2,3].map(:to_s) # applies it automatically! far less ugly than [1,2,3].map &:to_s
  => ["1", "2", "3"]

and Thread.abort_on_exception=true # kill program if a child thread dies--alert you earlier!

Don't leave home without these!
