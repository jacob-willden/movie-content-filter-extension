Tron 1:
One scene near-ish the end with risque bods.
Besides the various profanity.
Also the skull stuff near the very end.
and possibly killing the bad red guy.

"On the Double" http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/On_the_Double/70135642?trkid=496624  has some definite adult themes in there (adultery etc.). 
  No real violence or profanity that I noticed.
