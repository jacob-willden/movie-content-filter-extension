Basically to create a player description you tell it the window title and the coordinates 
of the "clock" as it plays, including the digits

Use the others are examples

  Some tips:
  
    use WinCheat to help with window names (under "Text") (alt+tab helps, too, since it displays titles).
    run scene-skipper with 'test' for the Edit Decision List filename: it will dump a screenshot using the player description
    use Paint.net to examine the dumped graphic and get coords (invert it to get easy negative coords).

NB that the clock coords can have negative start offsets, which mean "distance from the bottom right corner"

NB that you can specify "desktop" for the window name, meaning full screen.  This is easier, though not necessarily better,
than finding out the real way.

Here is how to specify a regex anywhere:

!ruby/regexp /abc/

like
key_name: !ruby/regexp /abc/

Post back with difficulties and/or questions.  You may need to tweak the unit tests for the OCR engine, too.  Non-trivial.
